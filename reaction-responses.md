### 2024-11-11 02:24 - galaxy and bottom-up perspective

in [my discussion on adderall](/drug-talk.md#2024-11-10-1524---some-thoughts-on-adderall), I talked about how the centre of a galaxy is a very attractive black-hole, which is vibrationally very similar to all of the stars in the galaxy because the the core of each star is essentially (ie, vibrationally very very similar) to the vibration of the vibration of a galaxy. we know (when looking out into space) that occasionally a star will go supernova,  blowing off all of it's outer layers, leaving behind only a very faint (but very attractive) core, which then (probably over the course of billions and billions and billions of years) starts to regain colour again as it begins to reform its outer (symbolic) layers, which then begin to produce the new spectrum of the the new solar environment for that star. when that happens, a new "solar regime" is born, and it's possible that some elements and "laws" of the previous solar system change (like the boiling point of water, masses, and decay rates). the new solar environment/regime is essentially a new symbolic implementation of the that star's derivative of the core of the galaxy. all things that star produces in the form of molecules and stuff like that flow out into the solar sphere, allowing the flourishing of life. all those atoms created by the star have their source as the core of the star, which is why the poles of the star recollect all of that decayed stuff on its "return back to its source".
the galaxy itself is just a giant black-hole, much like earth is. earth is like a large version of an electron, so it too has a conceptual core to it. when I say conceptual, I mean receptive or black -- and very attractive, so essentially a black-hole. a star also has a black-hole at its core, however, it's got layers and layers of stuff around it -- little spheres that build up so that now that black-hole has a sphere around of smaller spheres. I call those white-spheres, mostly because black is the opposite of white, but it doesn't have to be black. if the black-hole is clothed in a spectral-sphere, those are called electrons -- and if it's clothed in layers of more spheres like itself (mini stars) those are called protons. spectral-spheres/electrons do not have a continuous emission spectrum and don't in any way attempt to imitate the attraction spectrum of its core (or the core of its source). white-spheres/protons in contrast are built up of smaller versions of itself (it's like a fractal) of layers and layers of vibrational miniture versions of itself which all vibrate, and that vibration tries its best to build a symbolic output which (as closely as possible) imitates the attraction spectrum of its core. it's never perfect, so eventually the whole system is destined to fail (which is why the 2nd-ray perspective is the one who's continually less-than (its core) or constantly being defeated in its attempts to imitate its core (ie, stellar imposter syndrome)). spectral-spheres make no attempt at all to imitate its core attraction spectrum at all (which is the same as the star, which is a derivative of the galaxy's), and so because of its dissimilarity to its own core, it will decay, and fall apart, because the thing at its core can no longer hold it together (ie, the electron's gravity (nuclear attraction) isn't strong enough to keep all of its mini electrons in orbit).
therefore, because each star in the galaxy has a slightly different attraction spectrum at its core (which each of its units/elements/electrons) inherit, the star sets the rules for what element configurations are possible, and how long each configuration will hold together.

the galaxy's perspective is a lot different. the galaxy is very similar to earth (ie a spectral-sphere) in that it has a definite spectrum. it doesn't need to worry about any of that electron/spectral stuff, because all of that shows up and manifests in the place it needs to be, to match the vibration of all of the black-holes and protons that it has vibrating around. that environment is not exactly physical in the way that we think of it (where the physical stuff is there because of the rules imposed by the solar system) -- but is instead physical as a result of the vibration that it creates (ie, there are no rules, and all things exist because they are perceived to be there mentally). I'm fairly certain that earth is heading in the direction of where the conceptual dictates the physical (as opposed to how it is now where the star (and its physical rules, plus all of the protons that the sun has around) influence the conceptual), but I'm not sure when it's going to happen (probably not soon). the environment of the galaxy, can best be illustrated with the concept known as [living-blackness](/concepts/living-blackness.md) -- which is a state of mind where anything and everything felt takes on symbolic/manifest form instantly in an environment where there's nothing else. inside of the living-blackness the perceiver is (from their perspective) in a universe of their own, where the things that they want to appear, just because the concepts are summoned. there are no rules (only those of the vibrations imposed by the perceiver), so the manifest form can take on any shape and be there "just cause". inotherwords, the galaxy is a spectrum of all concepts which are attracted (things that the galaxy wants to be there), and so the galaxy (who is the perceiver of itself and its own creation) lives in a world where all of the things that it wants to be there, are there (just cause). it wants to see more and more of those thiags (ie, it is attractive to itself, and wants to see more and more highly resonant versions of itself come to it), and so therefore this spectrum of concepts that are wanted forms the core attraction spectrum serves as the basis for all of its derivative implementation (stars), which say, "pfft, no I don't want that, I want something else" or "yeah all of that, but these things too", etc. the star then tries out that world in its solar sphere to see how its derivative implementation will perform in the "real-world". sometimes it works out better, and there are improvements that are found (which the galaxy can choose to implement), and sometimes the derivative implementation fails and has to start over (ie, supernova).
so, when zoom out and look at the big-picture here, the galaxy is nothing other than a vulcan (-5+). it has a conceptual perspective of only-attraction (ie, it only adds in the things into its living-blackness that are attractive to it), the basic most simple version (the lowest or bottom of the spectum), because outside of itself and countless other symbolic implementations which are derivatives of itself. therefore, from the perspective of the galaxy, it is the midpoint, where all things outside of itself are symbolic. this is the "saturnian" (4) perspective,where on the bottom/inside is the cOnceptual (itself), and above/outside of it, is the stuff that's outside of it (ie the symbolic). all of the stuff that's outside of it is the 2nd-ray spectrum (which are the main-sequence-stars which surround the galaxy). each one of the stars, because of their constant/repetitive failures are all (sometimes significant) improvements on the conceptual system that the galaxy uses, each one creating a better and better (ie more continuous) spectrum all the way up to infinity (ie, source/1st-ray).
