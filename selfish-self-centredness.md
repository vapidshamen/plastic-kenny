# selfish-self-centredness

###	2025-02-15 18:13 - deeply self-centred

jenifer sent m5 an article today with the headline, "people who are	deeply self-centered usually display these 9 behaviors, according to psycology". I read it, and I'm convinced that the author of the article (Isabella Chase) is actually not all that self-centred. I strongly disagree with 2 of the points and have comments on the remaining 7 points. for this commentary, I will explore the dialectic of selfish vs selfless -- which isn't quite the same as self-centredness; it just makes the argument a bit clearer.

#### 1. they steer every conversation toward theirself.

in a world of pure-selfishness, everything perceivable has a self -- (some call this animism), and the idea here is that all things in the most selfish person's perception is that *all things are a reflection of the perceiver* -- meaning, that I can see myself inside of anyone, understand (most of) what they're experiencing from my perspective, and that the things they're experiencing are conceptually relatable to me (I'm a "know it all").
therefore, when listening to any conversation, I recognise myself as having a similar thing to the conversation or whatever, and *see myself in the conversation*. it's quite normal for me to see myself in everything that everyone is experiencing, and in a still relational perspective (ie, I'm still relative to everyone/everything else), I compare myself and relate. the more self-centred I get, the less I feel the need to relate to anyone else, and so over time, I've actually cared less and less about steering the conversation to myself. now, I just listen to something that is completely foreign to m5.
therefore, I actually present the idea that it's not the self-centred person, but the *relational person* that's interested in comparing/relating someone else's conversation to their own experience. a truly self-centred person cares not about the relativity of someone else's experience to their own.

#### 2. they're quick to dismiss your feelings.

again, in a world of pure-selfishness, everything that anyone can encounter is a reflection/derivative of myself (cause I'm the centre/creator of my universe and everything in it), the feelings that anyone experiences are all perceived from a superior point of view -- as in, "I've already experienced that and here's how I got around that problem" -- because a self-centered person isn't very strongly affected by others at all -- which means that all strong positive/negative emotion (something that would take someone away from their centre, kinda like any voltage above/below zero) no longer has any significant effect on them. others can exist and do all sorts of stuff, but it really has no effect on a truly self-centred person. inotherwords, no matter what anyone else is doing, they remain at fastest possible vibration with zero amplitude.
the ability to not be too strongly affected by others emotions and stuff makes a self-centred person also appear quite unempathetic, and that's because no matter what, that person is going to deviate very little from zero. nobody else's feelings are m6re important than m/ own.

#### 3. they crave (and hog) attention

well, duh. they're the centre of their universe, so obviously everything is about them. some people need others to recognise and validate that they are the centre of their universe, and others don't. I posit that it's actually the relativity people that need others to validate them, and most self-centred people don't.

#### 4. they don't apologize (at least not sincerly)

this one I agree with completely -- at least for me. I can't speak about how others experience self-centredness, so this is my perspective: in a world of only-attraction, there's no reason to ever apologize. an apology assumes that I've done something wrong or bad, and I no longer live in a world of good/bad or right/wrong. therefore, it'd be like aplogising to someone that the game took away one of their lives and made them start the level over after falling off of the cliff. all things are attracted, and there's no reason to put myself into a position where I'm now labeling myself as bad/wrong.
I do often times say the word, "sorry" or say that I shouldn't have done something (knowing/assuming full well that it was attracted). those expressions are "common courtesy" or whatever. it's like saying "excuse me", and I don't really mean it (I don't presume myself to actually be at fault or doing something wrong). I say those things to reduce friction in today's expectations for society.

#### 5. they believe that they're always right

of course they do; we're the centre of everything in our universe, and so (in our perCeption) *all things are relative to me*. a relative person will see their relativity between theirself and someone else (as if both points are in motion), however a self-centred person will see theirself as absolute (staying as close to zero, and having as little m6vement as possible), so we see ourself as absolute and everything else as a derivative of our own perception of the same idea.
this is actually the best form of perception. the self-centred perspective is actually possible for everyone to think this way. in fact, I believe it's our normal form of perception until we're taught by society and stuff to lose our self-centredness and instead satisfy others. living in relation to the other makes you a you; living in relation to only yourself and letting others be relative to that, makes me singular: I.

#### 6. they struggle to celebrate others

I strongly disagree with this one. in the world of maximum selfishness, all things I perceive are a reflection of me. if I rejoice in the accomplishment of others, I attract for myself (and them) more accomplishment. if I try to hold someone else back, because they're a reflection of m5, I'm actually holding myself back. there's no way I would ever want to do that.
in fact, the opposite is true: the better that everyone else feels around me, the better I feel too (better feeling = higher frequency, not more amplitude). in fact, the more different things that are around me, the broader spectrum of feeling (which implies higher frequency) I feel, so I'm actually encouraged to have more and more people doing better around me, than worse. a self-centred person derives no benefit from others doing worse (going lower in frequency), yet a person doing better around me will influence my frequenccy to rise as well -- and, as long as I'm capable of navigating at the faster speed, others do better, is only a benefit.

#### 7. they drop you when they don't need you

I strongly disagree with this one as well. a self-centred person does not *need* anything from anyone else. for a self-centred person, they *know* that their needs and desires are met as a function of attraction, and so there's no reason to perceive anyone else in terms of need/desire. if I'm using (or need) someone else to do something for me, I'm not self-centred or selfish at all.
in contrast, I do commiserate with this point on a different axis: I like to be around a person when they feel good to me (ie, when they resonate with me) -- and for as long as they feel good to me, they're fine. however, the moment that they start to feel bad to m5 (they are dissonant), I start to distance myself from them or drop them altogether.

#### 8. they have a habit of interrupting

I moderately disagree with this one. I used to interrupt a lot, and it was usually because of one of these reasons:
1. I wanted to prove myself or show that I know something before the other person says it
2. the thing they were about to say feels bad to me, and I don't want them to say something that feels bad to me, and/or I don't want to hear it.
3. I already think I know what they're going to say.

as I've gotten more and more stable in my self-centredness (not so strongly affected by others), I no longer feel like I need to steer the conversation away from things that are unconfortable to me. also, in the case of thinking I already know what they're going to say, I've actually found out that they present the idea in slightly different ways each time (according to what I'm attracting), so I instead just listen (because there's a conceptual resonance with what I'm attracting and what they want to tell me) and try to get they idea they're wanting to present to me.

#### 9. they twist the truth to their advantage

I fully agree with this. some people do it maliciously or to gain advantage over another -- and I posit that those people aren't truly self-centred -- because by trying to manipulate someone else's perception to get something, they're now making theirself relative to the other person (like a space probe using a planet's gravity to slingshot theirself a different direction). obviously, a person that is using someone else's perception (instead of their own) is not a person that's interested in trying to get as close to zero movement (no sudden changes) at all.
however, a self-centred person is going to want to constantly adjust their perception of everything around them, so that movements on the outside are no longer affecting them in any strong way anymore. so, the ability to take another persson's movement/influence and transform that energy into something else is a good skill to have; it is manipulation of self, not of others though, so it's another good skill to have.
the other technique that the self-centred person has here is the ability to minimise or reduce the impact of something. let's say that someone says something offensive, instead of being influenced by the offence, the self-centred person will instead see it as "just another opinion" or something like that -- to ensure that others aren't able to inflence them. in fact, the better the self-centred person gets at manipulating the "truth" to no longer affect them, the more self-centred the person is.













before I begin, I'd like to present an idea that will be helpful to understand where I'm coming from: I've been studyying DBT (dialectic behavior training) lately and so I've gotten used to looking at any idea as a point as on or between two dialectics. this article is about the extreme of self-centredness (selfishness),-- which means we must now find the opposite of that dialictic-- relational/integrated with everything else (selflessness). I feel like that dialectic is difficult to present,-- so I'd like to propose a similar (easier to understand) dialectic.
on one end of the dialiectic we will look at selfishness, which is that eveverything in that universe
