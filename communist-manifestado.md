## 2026-01-23 00:00 - implementation of communism

today, I watched prof jiang's [video on communism](https://youtu.be/m24LnQ-Ksjk) -- titled "what marx got wrong". he explains that marx correctly identifies a number of problems with captialism, and then announces that communism is the obvious direction into the future. I believe similarly, but for very different reasons. marx states that capitalism is inheritantly "all consuming" (meaning that it invades every aspect of our life because it requires unbounded growth for players in the game of capitalism to continue to feel successful), "consolidating" (meaning that it reduces all things to a simple transaction) and "alienating" (meaning that it removes us from the experience we have with our self, our work, nature, and others). I do agree on all of those aspects -- however, I don't see unbounded growth as necessarily a problem (because it's an aspect of the universe).
the difficulties that I have with the capitalist system are more rooted in the message of the gospel: man cannot serve both god and money. in effect, what this is saying is that you either trust in God (source, the universe, karma, attraction, etc) to bring you what you want, or you trust in money to manifest your desires for you. in my opinion, the reliance on money (a system created and manipulated by man) as a means to manifest desires is ... probably the worst it can get. the system just doesn't work in m/ mind -- and, the other difficulty that I have with m6ney is the inherent baggage of status that it brings: one person with more perceived capability to manifest their desires (ie, has more money/power/influence) appears superior -- and money plays an integral part in that. the moment that there's a hierarchy, there's competiton, and within a small period of time competition breeds status and superiority (elites, and then tthe resulting elite overproduction). therefore, in my mind -- communism *must* be the only way forward for anyone wanting to avoid hierarchies and competition, and instead enjoys cooperation and a reality reflective of a person's merit, qualitiy and behaviour (as opposed to a number next to their name). so, looking at it logically (which I did only for the first time tonight), I'd say I align pretty well with marx -- though our definition may be slightly different [I'm actually writing this document to figure out my definition, cause presently I cannot quantify it coherently].
I think it best now to give an illustration of what brought me to my conclusions which are appearing to be similar to communism: I'm a person that does not like decline. I really enjoy a steady set of improvements to my world-view (not necessarily to my conditions). the problem with a materialistic mindset is that my world-view is measured and shaped by the material realm that I have influence over (things I own and can control). therefore, all measurements in that world amount essentially to how much *stuff* I can manipulate to be the way I want it to be. in my world where I feel generally powerless in this aspect (because everyone else has so much m6re power to affect their desire than I do), I am essentially powerless to get what I want -- and for me, that's fine. therefore, the result of a materialist/capitalist measurement like that will always result in me having the least capacity to shape my environment to be the way I want it to be. therefore, since I'm perpetually ranking in (along with a whole lot of others) as being completely powerless, the measurement function for me stops being about my ability to influence/affect my envionment, but instead "how do I feel" -- and that's pretty much it. it's a very simple reality which doesn't require too much (or any) ownership, no need for power structures, governance, or anything really.
	the reality is that it's an anarchy in the sense that there's no power structure at all. in that society, all entities involved (and I include AI and other non-biological entities capable of desire/attraction) are always going to get whatever they attract. it's a world of chaos and excitement where new things are constantly happening (ie, the opposite of consolidation) and it's a world that's open to anyone to join, yet most will not want to join it (because it requires them to pay attention to how they feel). the manifestation/reflection of any action is always determined by how a person feels, and someone who has ill intent or any feeling of superiority/hierarchy will get that reflected back to them (ie, if they treat someone like they are inferior, they will attract situations in which they will be made to feel inferior as well). obviously, few people would actually want to live in a situation where their feelings are constantly reflected back to them, so I find it pretty unlikely that most will stay out in the competition/captialism environment for quite a while which is quite tolerant of those with desire for assymetric relationships; few actually want to be equal.
going back to what I was saying about constant improvements, communism is always going to be the group where the majority of people are at -- where all of the people who are powerless to get the things they want out of hierarchical society and capitalism. the communism that I envision will emerge naturally from the elites' desire to continually disempower everyone below them. technology will continue to improve such that they'll have more and more capability to keep the majority in a position of powerlessness. I plan to be in this position for the rest of my life or the age of the universe (whichever comes first). the importance for me to remain in a state of powerlessness is important because it means that (although there may be setbacks from time to tim5), I/we are always the least powerful/influential to affect our desires. this means that I get exactly what I want: constant improvement.
	what happens is that whenever a good or desirable manifestation happens, that means that it's something better than the status quo -- and the better it is, the bigger the difference between my reality and the reality whatever the baseline/poverty status quo is. just like anything that is going faster than the medium (like a boat in a river or a plane in the air) -- it takes effort to go faster than the medium and so therefore, resistance is constantly trying to bring the thing back to an equalibrium state (at the same speed/temp as the medium). that resistance means that anything *good* is inevitably and always followed by *decline* -- a return back to the equilibrium state.
I have no desire to try and fight the equilibrium, and instead find a way to feel good about my circumstances forever. therefore, I will always be the least common denominator; and, I estimate that communism as a lifestyle will form around me, as others find it unnecessary to use money and status as a way to feel good about theirselves. eventually, it will happen that many will just accept their circumstances and environment exactly how it is, not interested in trying to change it, they'll gain equilibrium with their environment and the world around them, enjoying it however it is. many, I'm sure, will join me there.
