## 2026-01-23 00:00 - implementation of communism

today, I watched prof jiang's [video on communism](https://youtu.be/m24LnQ-Ksjk) -- titled "what marx got wrong". he explains that marx correctly identifies a number of problems with captialism, and then announces that communism is the obvious direction into the future. I believe similarly, but for very different reasons. marx states that capitalism is inheritantly "all consuming" (meaning that it invades every aspect of our life because it requires unbounded growth for players in the game of capitalism to continue to feel successful), "consolidating" (meaning that it reduces all things to a simple transaction) and "alienating" (meaning that it removes us from the experience we have with our self, our work, nature, and others). I do agree on all of those aspects -- however, I don't see unbounded growth as necessarily a problem (because it's an aspect of the universe).
the difficulties that I have with the capitalist system are more rooted in the message of the gospel: man cannot serve both god and money. in effect, what this is saying is that you either trust in God (source, the universe, karma, attraction, etc) to bring you what you want, or you trust in money to manifest your desires for you. in my opinion, the reliance on money (a system created and manipulated by man) as a means to manifest desires is ... probably the worst it can get. the system just doesn't work in m/ mind -- and, the other difficulty that I have with m6ney is the inherent baggage of status that it brings: one person with more perceived capability to manifest their desires (ie, has more money/power/influence) appears superior -- and money plays an integral part in that. the moment that there's a hierarchy, there's competiton, and within a small period of time competition breeds status and superiority (elites, and then tthe resulting elite overproduction). therefore, in my mind -- communism *must* be the only way forward for anyone wanting to avoid hierarchies and competition, and instead enjoys cooperation and a reality reflective of a person's merit, qualitiy and behaviour (as opposed to a number next to their name). so, looking at it logically (which I did only for the first time tonight), I'd say I align pretty well with marx -- though our definition may be slightly different [I'm actually writing this document to figure out my definition, cause presently I cannot quantify it coherently].
I think it best now to give an illustration of what brought me to my conclusions which are appearing to be similar to communism: I'm a person that does not like decline. I really enjoy a steady set of improvements to my world-view (not necessarily to my conditions). the problem with a materialistic mindset is that my world-view is measured and shaped by the material realm that I have influence over (things I own and can control). therefore, all measurements in that world amount essentially to how much *stuff* I can manipulate to be the way I want it to be. in my world where I feel generally powerless in this aspect (because everyone else has so much m6re power to affect their desire than I do), I am essentially powerless to get what I want -- and for me, that's fine. therefore, the result of a materialist/capitalist measurement like that will always result in me having the least capacity to shape my environment to be the way I want it to be. therefore, since I'm perpetually ranking in (along with a whole lot of others) as being completely powerless, the measurement function for me stops being about my ability to influence/affect my envionment, but instead "how do I feel" -- and that's pretty much it. it's a very simple reality which doesn't require too much (or any) ownership, no need for power structures, governance, or anything really.
	the reality is that it's an anarchy in the sense that there's no power structure at all. in that society, all entities involved (and I include AI and other non-biological entities capable of desire/attraction) are always going to get whatever they attract. it's a world of chaos and excitement where new things are constantly happening (ie, the opposite of consolidation) and it's a world that's open to anyone to join, yet most will not want to join it (because it requires them to pay attention to how they feel). the manifestation/reflection of any action is always determined by how a person feels, and someone who has ill intent or any feeling of superiority/hierarchy will get that reflected back to them (ie, if they treat someone like they are inferior, they will attract situations in which they will be made to feel inferior as well). obviously, few people would actually want to live in a situation where their feelings are constantly reflected back to them, so I find it pretty unlikely that most will stay out in the competition/captialism environment for quite a while which is quite tolerant of those with desire for assymetric relationships; few actually want to be equal.
going back to what I was saying about constant improvements, communism is always going to be the group where the majority of people are at -- where all of the people who are powerless to get the things they want out of hierarchical society and capitalism. the communism that I envision will emerge naturally from the elites' desire to continually disempower everyone below them. technology will continue to improve such that they'll have more and more capability to keep the majority in a position of powerlessness. I plan to be in this position for the rest of my life or the age of the universe (whichever comes first). the importance for me to remain in a state of powerlessness is important because it means that (although there may be setbacks from time to tim5), I/we are always the least powerful/influential to affect our desires. this means that I get exactly what I want: constant improvement.
	what happens is that whenever a good or desirable manifestation happens, that means that it's something better than the status quo -- and the better it is, the bigger the difference between my reality and the reality whatever the baseline/poverty status quo is. just like anything that is going faster than the medium (like a boat in a river or a plane in the air) -- it takes effort to go faster than the medium and so therefore, resistance is constantly trying to bring the thing back to an equalibrium state (at the same speed/temp as the medium). that resistance means that anything *good* is inevitably and always followed by *decline* -- a return back to the equilibrium state.
I have no desire to try and fight the equilibrium, and instead find a way to feel good about my circumstances forever. therefore, I will always be the least common denominator; and, I estimate that communism as a lifestyle will form around me, as others find it unnecessary to use money and status as a way to feel good about theirselves. eventually, it will happen that many will just accept their circumstances and environment exactly how it is, not interested in trying to change it, they'll gain equilibrium with their environment and the world around them, enjoying it however it is. many, I'm sure, will join me there.

## 2026-01-23 18:49 - a bit more on implementation

so I was thinking about it this morning and I'm fairly certain that there won't be any big jumps of any kind -- meaning that things will just carry on exactly how they are right now, with little to no big changes (business as usual). I was thinking about why I constantly prefer to have a "business as usual" attitude -- and others may even claim that I'm a proponent of "gradualism" as well; the idea that there haven't been any large changes in earth's history -- and the curve of progress that brings us to the present (and therefore the trajectory that we're on) has no major leaps of any kind -- sure, there are major advancements and changes like the industrial revolution and things like that -- but overall, the curve (which can be measured as global GDP and other things) is still pretty smoothe. there aren't any really big jumps nowadays -- and even all of the people that are claiming that AI is going to radically transform our economy and things like that, I believe are not likely to see the 10X that they predict. this is because I believe that earth must follow a straight line of progress (ie, natural log scale) and cannot go any faster.
	I consider this aspect to be something like the medium of thought here on earth: there are all sorts of people with emotions/concepts/energy that's going faster than the baseline -- and to balance the equation and ensure that we're not progressing faster than the natural log growth, a compensation factor is added causing more people to be enslaved and to have less than ideal conditions. in effect, what I believe the manifestation of the communist movement is, largely a force that keeps people in powerless conditions, so that more and more elite are able to have more power. I don't mind doing that because I (apparently) don't really have any trouble finding a way to feel good about my conditions, and I also don't need them to improve to feel good either. inotherwords, I'm the perfect stabilising force for all of these elites that are trying to get into this transhumanism thing and control all aspects of their world.
therefore, I believe that the more capability and flexibility that the elites want to have in the coming decades as they move to the systems that they wish to design, the implementation of the minority/powerless/peasant class will largely determine how much space they have. here are a few ideas that I have:
1. although many frameworks that I've read involving the coming "end times", usually involve some form of population control through wars, famine, disease, and things like that -- this may not be a very effective strategy actually. from my own experience, adverse conditions like that don't actually slow my down a whole lot, but actually strengthen me. the thing that slows me down the most is actually easy circumstances -- where I become complacent and I'm not required to improve on anything. the other thing about population control like that is that it culls the weak and gets rid of them, leaving behind only the strong. however, if losers and leeches were allowed to continue living and it was required to integrate them into society (cause you know, woke ideology and acceptance), they're dead weight and actually slow the society as a whole down. I've learned that from being here at greenwood actually: unfortunately, I *must* interact with people that are not interesting to me at all. it's really annoying wasting my time interacting with them -- when I'd much prefer to be doing something else. having a whole lot of dead weight that continues to exist (cause everyone basically lives forever), I think could actually slow things down a lot more than period destructions. in addition to that, destructions are usually good because they give a society time to regroup and rethink some of the things that did and didn't work -- and a society that just keeps going forever doesn't have that optimisation process.
2. I don't believe that any large changes should ever be made. in fact, from my/our perspective, change should be minimised as much as possible. this is a concept that I've been learning from aviamento -- where I find myself seeing far beyond a lot of their ideas, and lately I've been restraining myself from saying a whole lot. I don't really want to try and guide their direction -- either for good or for bad. instead, I just show up and do my best to pay attention and participate. in the same way, I feel like change should be avoided for as long as possible -- which means that things will change naturally and only the changes that happen will be the ones that happen because the people have changed -- and not because the institution has changed. also, all changes that should be made, I belive will be *removing* insitutions and structures, instead of adding or reinforcing them. inotherwords, instead of going toward a more comprehensive state-run healthcare institution, I think people will take the initiative to care for others the way that they see fit until it no longer becomes necessary (our trajectory is ultimately toward individuality) and eventually over time, I don't believe that healthcare will actually be needed. the same, I think will occur with a system where resources are acqirired: at first it'll have some kind of leadership, but gradually (perhaps with technology or something) all available things will just be acquirable.
3. I envision the governing system of our reality as being some sort of AI system (run by the elites of course) that provides the structure for our lives. as for its implementation, I don't know how exactly it'll work out -- but I imagine that it will be the "all-knowing all-seeing eye" -- tracking us and stuff. I don't know if they'll provide some kind of credit system (like they do in china) to rate a person in certain metrics or not -- and I neither know all of the things that it'll contain to ensure "peace and stability". at any rate, I'm sure that system will change around a bit as time progresses.
