### 2024-11-11 22:50 - observe, describe, participate

today I learned something really great in dbt class that I'd never noticed before: observation, in it's purest non-judgemental form is just receiving emotional input. we were talking about the infinite feedback loop (unless interupted) of observing something, having an emotional responce to it, which produces a thought (a description/judgement/etc) which then produces a another emotion -- and this goes on infinitely forever. lemme back up, because when I say "observe", what it means to me is when I defocus my eyes (so they look straight ahead or generally not at anything specific), it feels like I take a step back and when that happens, I'm observing myself -- I experience all of my sensory input (my eyes still see, I still hear sounds, etc) but all of the sensory data that's coming in produces a stream of emotions/concepts -- which if any of those emotional observations is strong enough, my rational mind jumps in to figure out what it is that's causing the strong emotional responce. that's the "judgement" phase -- where my brain has been trained to identify danger, or something that needs my consciousness back in the driver's seat again, and once again my consciousness zooms back into my head and I'm in my body again, fully rationalising/processing the conceptual/emotional input and responding to the situation in the way that I've trained my symbolic brain to respond.
it was such a powerful realisation to me to be able to see that in pure observation mode, I'm not processing anything symbolically,-- and thinking on it, trying it out consciously, and contemplating my observation about observation, I realised that mode is the default mode that newborns and children who have not yet really learned to respond symbolically (with words and sentences) are: they're just taking it in. when I was younger I watched a baby (very young) accidentally get hit by an object -- and when the object hit them, there was no reaction at all. their body didn't move to try and block it, move out of the way, or anything -- and even the realisation that the object hitting them caused pain didn't even register for a bit either -- and it took a moment to react to the pain by crying. when I say "symbolically respond" -- I don't mean just words, but I mean everything from body movement and words to thoughts and stuff (anything measurable inside the body). that's my second realisation too, which is that everything from thoughts ("why did you throw that at me", "wtf bro, I'm gonna throw something back", etc) are all *learned* (or rather I should say *trained* responces to the emotional/conceptual stimulus). therefore, then it's easy to see that the "judgement" part is actually a layer on top of the the individual resonses, which categorises and filters out the stuff that's not necessary to turn into a thought.
later on, the course teaches non-judgementalness or acceptance (which is itself a judgement: the judgement that the thing I'm observing is acceptable). in fact, the whole phase of judgement that happens in the brain is quite interesting as well, because judgement isn't always the same; it's strongly affected by emotional state, because the same thing can happen to me in a state of frustration and that gets routed to a symbolic (neuronal) response that is trained when I'm in that emotional state.
	it appears that the training happens by observation as well, because I watch mom/dad respond to something a way in their state of frustration (emotional state, or protons is just a vibration and I'm not limited by distance to feel how someone feels, so when I see someone respond to something, that automatically gets associated with the vibration of the emotional state that they make the action in) and so my mirror neurons get aligned in such a way that they'll fire to perform the same action my emotional state is the same as theirs.
then, in another emotional state, it's very common that I'll judge the same thing differently -- so when I train my brain to be in a state of non-judgementalness or acceptance, I'm forcing the routing of the emotional responce into a dead-end destinaton. therefore, we can think of the brain's emotional responce system as a set of nerons which are all (like antennas) trained to receive an impulse from the vibrating protons in my emotional state which matches the frequency of the emotional state. in one state some neurons fire and in another other neurons fire. all of the neurons exist simultaneously and they're all waiting to fire, but they're only activated by the state that one is in. I know for me personally, I'll observe something and upon observation I'll have more than one responce happen at once -- which cause my body to jitter or move non-fluidly -- or me to feel tounge-tied, or unable to express the responce in words in a cohesive way (because I'm trying to say more than one thing at one time -- like I literally "hear" 2+ full sentence responces in my head all at the same time, yet my mouth only makes incoherent or grunting noises).
next, "describe" is listed as another mode of mindfulness -- which is where I take the conceptual input from the observation and I turn that into words and ideas. it too is an emotional responce, but when those neurons fire, they get routed down through a lot of other neurons to form coherent grammar and sentence structures. this was especially noticeable to me when I learned spanish, becuse I had to route the conceptual responce through a different part of my brain (ie, through a different set of neurons) which would produce the mouth/tounge movements necessary to produce spanish words instead of english ones. like judgement, there are also a whole lot of neurons that only fire in different emotional states -- because I would notice that the tone of my voice would contain parts of my emotional state, and I simply couldn't put into voice some concepts in some emotional states.
finally, "participate" is a particularly interesting mode of being, because it combines the two previous modes into one: I'm *observing* someone/something else, and getting emotional/conceptual input, yet at the same time I'm simultaneously converting that input directly into output (usually without a whole lot of processing/judgement) to it. for me, this is when my brain is most succeptible to being manipulated by others because I'm directly converting emotional input into symbolic output, responding in a similar way as those whom I'm participating with; it's my most "vunerable" state of being, because (unless there's something which gives a really strong emotional responce which triggers one of my red-flags) I'm completely just mimicking/reflecting the other participants.
	for me, as I lowered my resistance to things (ie, negative judgement neurons), I became more and more "reflective" -- which just means that by default I participate with the other person, allowing their judgements to also be my judgments, training my neurons to fire the same way as theirs are firing in the same emotional state as they're in.
for me, the participation state is nearly the same as the observation state,-- however the difference is that there isn't that step back where I'm observing myself. in fact, in my mind, I'm performing the same exact movements, sounds, words, dance, etc as they are doing even if my body is not participating. I know that kids do this all the time as they watch adults -- because, as their symbolic (neuronal) system is usually not developed enough tto actually let their body move/speak/think in the same way as the person they're observing, they're participating with them in their mind as if the the other person's body were their own. in fact, when I'm fully participating with someone, not only do I experience their emotions and stuff, my mind's body also experiences the same thing that their body experiences (ie, I have a sense of their sensory input as well as my own). I know their body is different than my own, but I'm fully engaged in what they're doing and experince it simultaneously to my own body sensations.

### 2024-11-11 23:55 - rational mind, emotional mind, and wise mind

the other thing that I was prompted to realise today in dbt class was that wisdom is a synthesis of output from both the emotional and the rational mind.
in the mindfulness module, following the "what" skills (observe, describe, participate), there's the "how" skills (non-judgementally, one-mindfully, effectively). similar to the "what" skills, they also correspond to the different minds: when observing I'm in the emotional mind, where I receive sensory input (touch, sound, taste, etc) and convert that input into emotional data. then, when I'm describing mode, I'm in the rational mind, where I'm converting something emotional/conceptual into something rational/symbolic (ie, a thought, movement, voice, expression). then, the particpate mode is a sythesis of the two minds, where I'm engaged emotionally in what I'm participating in, and also performing action.
	unfortunately "describe" may not be the best word -- I'd use "output" instead, because the rational mind is turning the emotional/conceptual input that it gets into some kind of output, whereas the emotional mind is converting sensory input (doesn't matter if it's the imagination, or something seen, felt, heard, etc). inotherwords, the rational mind prepares the inner conceptual/emotional data to be presented to the outer world, whereas the emotional mind takes in sensory data (coming from internal thoughts or the imagination) and converting them into emotional/conceptual data to be used in the internal world. inotherwords, the emotional mind outputs to the internal world and the rational mind outputs to the external world (though technically others aren't supposed to hear my thoughts, they produce signals which can be received by others on the outside world). therfore, I posit that it makes more sense to say that "participate" is the synthesis of "output" and "observe".
the "how" skills are also quite similar as well, where "non-judgementally" corresponds to the emotional mind (ie, I'm just observing without making any judgements), then "effectively" correponds to the rational mind, because I have to process, focus, and make assessments -- and no two people will ever evaluate the effectiveess of something in the same exactly the same way either because everyone's neuronal structure is slightly different. additionally, similar to how judgement varies with emotional state, effectiveness evaluations also vary with emotional state as well (ie, when angry, I may think that raising my voice is a more effective way to get my point across). finally, "one-mindfully" corresponds to the wise mind, where (like participation) I'm fully engaged in my reality operation, both emotionally and rationally; I'm fully engaged, not divided between my emotional/inner world and my rational/exterior world.

###	2024-11-15 23:36 - dialectic balance training

today, we had a dbt skills class at friendly harbor, and jeremiah wanted us to talk about "willingness vs willfulness", and another one which I hadn't heard of, but essentially it's taking the other person's perspective into consideration. in short, it was the idea of being open-minded to other ideas, instead of forcing our opinion on another. oh, that's righ -- the last one was to contemplate on "stigmas". quickly, I noticed the dialetcic between willingness vs willfulness, because wfillfulness, we force/project our opinion out into the target (ie another person or the label that the stigma targets), meanwhile willingness is a receptive or open state of mind, where we are open to something new, not quickly judging it -- and anyway, it came to a lull in the conversation, and jeremiah opened it up for others to talk about the subject. noticing that willfulness is push and willingness is pull, I wanted to illustrate the dialectic -- so I started out by saying that dbt stands for "dialectic balance training" -- which is wrong, and so many were quite quick to point that out to me. slightly embarrassed, and obviously not knowing what I was talking about, I lost my chance to illustrate the dialectic.
anyway, thinking about it further since then, I noticed that emotional and rational minds are at either end of the dialectic just like willingness and willfulness. however, the sythesis of emotional and rational thinking is wisdom -- well, then there must be the same thing for willingness and willfulness too -- so I thought about it a moment. you see, parallel to this, I've been trying to figure out [a visualisation exercise](/visualisation-discussion.md) -- which is a notably willfull activity. however, it's considered by a lot of people to be something that's positive. the same is true for "positive thinking" as well, as I'm exerting my positively willful position on the situation. that kind of reality processing is what happens all the time in the rational mind. it's not the non-judgemental perspective that the emotional mind takes when it just allows reality in, making no judgement about it.
therefore, I posit that willfulness is actually a good thing, *if it's something wanted/positive/desirable*, or if it's **effective**. I emphasise effective, because "effective", is itself a partially willful operation. what I mean is: if I want to judge the effectiveness of something, yet refuse to collect any data at all, I'm making a completely blind judgement. that judgement is an ideology that I'm repeating, or something that I've been trained to believe (by myself or others, doesn't matter). it's a trained responce to the input concept, and not necessarily the data itself. when I recognise the concept or idea, I *automatically* respond with the neurons that have vibrational similarity to that concept. that method of reacting to something is precisely the same way that trauma works -- where upon recognising emotions or concepts, I automatically react in a way which I think I can fight or flight the trauma. so, for "effective" to actually be effective, I must also be *receptive* to input data that doesn't necessarily align with my pre-judgement or *stigma* that has been given to a specific concept.
inotherwords, to actually be "effective", complete willingness (to accept something without any rational analysis) isn't going to be effective -- unless the person that is offering something that completely aligns with my self identity, which is unlikely -- and neither is complete willfulness either, because then no matter what anyone else has to offer, I'm projecting out my anxiety, fears, pre-judgment, etc out there, without giving anyone an opportunity to present data to me that may challenge my perspective.
therefore, I posit that in order be effective, I must both be willful and willing. I want to show up with positive expectations and thinking (willful), and then -- as I'm going along, be able to receive the reactions from those around, and adjust accordingly (willing to: radically accept them wherever they are, not judging them, and not needing them to be different). I think a balance of the dialectics (going to neither extreme, but using a synthesis of both) produces a wise mind and an effective strategy to participate with others in meaningful relationships.
