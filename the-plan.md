# the-plan

### 2024-08-21 17:05 - starting over

there were a series of unfortunate circumstances and events that resulted in mom "kicking me out" of her house -- it wasn't exactly "kicking me out" -- cause no violence or anything happened -- however, I do think it it's probably OK though. one of its side-effects is that it's caused me to have to become an emitter now: I've got to find a job and essentially get back into the system. previously to this, mom has guardianship ove me, which means that she manages all of my finances and all of that stuff.
    when I first got to pueblo in 2017, I fought her on this plan, because I was still thinking that I wanted to be an emitter, doing all of the the financial stuff for myself, ensuring that my future is moving in the direction that I want it to go; so I fought her on it. however, listening to abraham, I realised that I did't *really want* to be putting up that kind of resistance to mom, and instead decided that I'll be much more passive and just let her do all of it. I eventually came to the conclusion that I don't want to deal with money anymore, and it's fine in she just does it all -- cause, even if she were to totally screw me over, "it's just more energy"
        the idea that every time someone is pushing me in a direction or blocking/thwarting my efforts, they have to exert some amout of energy to do it -- and even though they may be able to alter my trajectory, or try and stop me in some way (ie, destructive interference), the energy that's deleted/thwarted/destructively-interfored, isn't actually destroyed -- but instead, it just becomes a very high frequency version of it's former self. therefore, all efforts to try and impede that energy, eventually return in a higher frequency form. so, if I stay on the lower frequency (physical) spectrum where those that vibration is being deleted, it appears as if nothing is going anywhere, but if instead I release resistance myself (ie, emitting in opposition), I'm able to start attracting those things that were destroyed/blocked into my life again, in a higher frequency form. inothrwords, all efforts to block someone, only add energy into the equation, but that energy is at a much higher (not-physical/visible) frequency, and so is therefore *not yet manifested* -- that's the high energy bank account (or "vortex") that everyone has which is attracting our physical/manifested reality.
    so, I just gave up on trying to be an emitter completely, and instead worked out that what I want to become is a person that's "only-attraction". presently in 3d, that's quite an impossible feat, because without the ability to emit, I wouldn't even be able to see or speak. in addition to that, it'd require quite a dramatic change to my DNA and a number of other things (like communication: if I can only respond to things, how do I ask strangers questions or tell new/novel things to people). it's quite a challenge to try and figure out how to make it possible for me to become only-attraction, actually. however, it's what I want to do -- and in the process of figuring out the basics to how it's even possible, I discovered quite a lot about how DNA and the human body works (see [24andme](https://github.com/heavyk/24andme) and [25andme](https://github.com/heavyk/25andme)).
so, with the idea that I'd have to start implementing my only-attraction idea in software/perception first (cause I believe our DNA is a reflection of our perception), I just assumed that I'm going to just become more and more passive and low resistance (resistance is emisssion at a frequency which is dissonant or repulsive to the higher frequency concepts (ie emotions) which are in my "vortex") -- and then, somehow the things that I'm wanting to do (ie become the first plastic/only-attraction human) would just become possible. I was convinced then, and am still convinced that I have to just keep waiting for the things/concepts I'm attracting to come to me.
*however* -- when mom has kicked me out of the house, I can no longer just sit around and only passive/reactive (ie, only-attraction), and now I have to start making decisions for myself, saying "this is the way I'm going to go", etc. -- which now forces me to be an emitter. I don't really want to be an emitter and to say this is what needs to be done and all of that, because that's going in exactly the opposite direction of the one I want to go. I'm kinda sad that I have to be an emitter, but I suppose it'll be OK for a bit -- and perhaps it's "a necessary evil" or "the ends justifies the means" -- in that I'll be an emitter for some time, to get all of the science and stuff all built so that I can alter my DNA and stuff to become only-attraction later. so, now that I'm forced to be an emitter, the gloves come off -- and I'm gonna do just that. **the world will become a reflection of my perception** (whether others like it or not).
    however, I'm really having a difficult time with being an emitter -- and I don't really want to do it. for example I found a bridge that I like to hang out under (5th st, under the I-25), and the other night I got really stoned with my neighbour (weed makes me much more emissive), and cause I'd passed the time when I can get into the shelter, I was going to hang out all night under the bridge and just chill out there -- however, I notice that when I'm under that bridge (I like laying in the centre divider), I cause a lot of strange weather patterns, and also since it's on the hill a bit, it affects the rest of pueblo all the way down to the river. also, one time I tried star-watching before going to the shelter, and mutiple people complained about not being able to sleep, and having heart palpitations and stuff -- which means that my emission (star-watching, like weed also makes me very emissive) -- and I just can't do it. it feels really bad to me to get all pumped up and super emissive and then to go and blast the whole city with my energy. the majority of the people here don't feel good in my energy (they make it known with their loud motors that they don't like it) -- and I don't want to push anyone to be forced into my energy. so while they're putting me in a situation where I'm supposed to be emissive, *I can't get myself to be the guy that's forcing everyone into my system*. I don't like how being assertive like that feels; and I have to see and interact with the people in pueblo, and I don't like the way thier disapproval of my actions (being emissive smoking weed or star-watching feels).
so I feel I've got to make a decision here soon, and stick to it: either go full blast emitter and drive all of the people away here that don't like my energy (leaving only those compatible with me) -- or, I have to go somewhere else. it's not likely that I'm going full blast emitter, cause I don't like how it feels, so I've either got to play the long game cause my energy keeps rising and AOE keeps expanding -- so since I'll outlive everyone here that doesn't like how I feel, and it's not likely that more will come to a place that feels bad to them, we'll separate and grow apart naturally. also, since it's quite likely that anywhere I go, there will always be those that are incompatible with my energy, I it seems to me that the best option is to do neither: just stay put, and don't push against others and let things work theirselves out naturally.

### 2024-08-21 18:14 - necessary evil

there was a narrative that I prticularly liked that I picked up from the "workers & resources" game, which I [made into my own thing](https://github.com/heavyk/25andme/blob/main/WSSR.md). I liked the narrative and think it's a viable idea place to try and work on the science necessary to make plastic-kenny (only-attraction DNA possible). I also combined that narrative with the barbie movie narrative as well, cause both male and female versions of plastic-kenny are possible (making many kens and many barbies a new "third gender" or another species of human possible (there are actually [3 different models](https://github.com/heavyk/25andme/blob/main/3x-6x-10x.md) in addition to the XX/XY models extant)), so my current plan is to do that narrative, but instead of doing a loan (I just can't find a way to make the loan part of it work), I want to just do the whole thing myself. I want to do odd-jobs and stuff around pueblo until I've saved up ~$20K, and then I'll just move to russia, china, brasil, india, or austrailia (haven't decided yet), and then just let my charisma do all of the work. from there I'm sure I'll be able to figure out the science necessary, and "spearhead" the whole operation -- and though I don't really want to be the boss that's telling everyone what to do, unless I can figure out another way, I'll just consider that "a means to an end" -- and just do it.
things could obviously change between now and then, but I really feel at the moment this is the "plan". it's also going to take me quite a while to save up that amount of money too -- but whatever -- during my time in pueblo doing jobs and saving, I'll have a lot of time to keep resistance low. I'll probably stay homeless for the majority or entire duration as well, cause rent is expensive, and I don't really want to get too settled into a place I'm not even going to stay.
I'm taking it pretty slow, allowing myself to flail about right now, cause I'm still not really 100% sure what I'm doing, but once I get a job and start saving and stuff, I find it pretty likely that I'm going to quit drugs and stuff. the other thing is that mom wants me to try out these psych meds (vraylar and latuda) cause she thinks it'll be a whole lot easier for me to get a job and stuff, if the thoser drugs can help me to be "normal" and be around other people easier (I'm finding it difficult to get a job, probably cause nobody wants to be around me) -- so that also me be another "necessary evil" that I'll have to do to try and make this plan (which I don't even think will work) to go through. we'll see. I'm not sure how many "necessary evils" I'll have to commit, to try and get this thing going. --- or maybe they're like tests to see *how much I really want it* -- cause at this point, I don't really care anymore. I'm not conviced this is the winning plan, and can easily walk away from it. seems the short-term goal is to save money, and find a way to outlive everyone else.
