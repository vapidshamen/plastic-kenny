# the-plan

### 2024-08-21 17:05 - starting over

there were a series of unfortunate circumstances and events that resulted in mom "kicking me out" of her house -- it wasn't exactly "kicking me out" -- cause no violence or anything happened -- however, I do think it it's probably OK though. one of its side-effects is that it's caused me to have to become an emitter now: I've got to find a job and essentially get back into the system. previously to this, mom has guardianship ove me, which means that she manages all of my finances and all of that stuff.
    when I first got to pueblo in 2017, I fought her on this plan, because I was still thinking that I wanted to be an emitter, doing all of the the financial stuff for myself, ensuring that my future is moving in the direction that I want it to go; so I fought her on it. however, listening to abraham, I realised that I did't *really want* to be putting up that kind of resistance to mom, and instead decided that I'll be much more passive and just let her do all of it. I eventually came to the conclusion that I don't want to deal with money anymore, and it's fine in she just does it all -- cause, even if she were to totally screw me over, "it's just more energy"
        the idea that every time someone is pushing me in a direction or blocking/thwarting my efforts, they have to exert some amout of energy to do it -- and even though they may be able to alter my trajectory, or try and stop me in some way (ie, destructive interference), the energy that's deleted/thwarted/destructively-interfored, isn't actually destroyed -- but instead, it just becomes a very high frequency version of it's former self. therefore, all efforts to try and impede that energy, eventually return in a higher frequency form. so, if I stay on the lower frequency (physical) spectrum where those that vibration is being deleted, it appears as if nothing is going anywhere, but if instead I release resistance myself (ie, emitting in opposition), I'm able to start attracting those things that were destroyed/blocked into my life again, in a higher frequency form. inothrwords, all efforts to block someone, only add energy into the equation, but that energy is at a much higher (not-physical/visible) frequency, and so is therefore *not yet manifested* -- that's the high energy bank account (or "vortex") that everyone has which is attracting our physical/manifested reality.
    so, I just gave up on trying to be an emitter completely, and instead worked out that what I want to become is a person that's "only-attraction". presently in 3d, that's quite an impossible feat, because without the ability to emit, I wouldn't even be able to see or speak. in addition to that, it'd require quite a dramatic change to my DNA and a number of other things (like communication: if I can only respond to things, how do I ask strangers questions or tell new/novel things to people). it's quite a challenge to try and figure out how to make it possible for me to become only-attraction, actually. however, it's what I want to do -- and in the process of figuring out the basics to how it's even possible, I discovered quite a lot about how DNA and the human body works (see [24andme](https://github.com/heavyk/24andme) and [25andme](https://github.com/heavyk/25andme)).
so, with the idea that I'd have to start implementing my only-attraction idea in software/perception first (cause I believe our DNA is a reflection of our perception), I just assumed that I'm going to just become more and more passive and low resistance (resistance is emisssion at a frequency which is dissonant or repulsive to the higher frequency concepts (ie emotions) which are in my "vortex") -- and then, somehow the things that I'm wanting to do (ie become the first plastic/only-attraction human) would just become possible. I was convinced then, and am still convinced that I have to just keep waiting for the things/concepts I'm attracting to come to me.
*however* -- when mom has kicked me out of the house, I can no longer just sit around and only passive/reactive (ie, only-attraction), and now I have to start making decisions for myself, saying "this is the way I'm going to go", etc. -- which now forces me to be an emitter. I don't really want to be an emitter and to say this is what needs to be done and all of that, because that's going in exactly the opposite direction of the one I want to go. I'm kinda sad that I have to be an emitter, but I suppose it'll be OK for a bit -- and perhaps it's "a necessary evil" or "the ends justifies the means" -- in that I'll be an emitter for some time, to get all of the science and stuff all built so that I can alter my DNA and stuff to become only-attraction later. so, now that I'm forced to be an emitter, the gloves come off -- and I'm gonna do just that. **the world will become a reflection of my perception** (whether others like it or not).
    however, I'm really having a difficult time with being an emitter -- and I don't really want to do it. for example I found a bridge that I like to hang out under (5th st, under the I-25), and the other night I got really stoned with my neighbour (weed makes me much more emissive), and cause I'd passed the time when I can get into the shelter, I was going to hang out all night under the bridge and just chill out there -- however, I notice that when I'm under that bridge (I like laying in the centre divider), I cause a lot of strange weather patterns, and also since it's on the hill a bit, it affects the rest of pueblo all the way down to the river. also, one time I tried star-watching before going to the shelter, and mutiple people complained about not being able to sleep, and having heart palpitations and stuff -- which means that my emission (star-watching, like weed also makes me very emissive) -- and I just can't do it. it feels really bad to me to get all pumped up and super emissive and then to go and blast the whole city with my energy. the majority of the people here don't feel good in my energy (they make it known with their loud motors that they don't like it) -- and I don't want to push anyone to be forced into my energy. so while they're putting me in a situation where I'm supposed to be emissive, *I can't get myself to be the guy that's forcing everyone into my system*. I don't like how being assertive like that feels; and I have to see and interact with the people in pueblo, and I don't like the way thier disapproval of my actions (being emissive smoking weed or star-watching feels).
so I feel I've got to make a decision here soon, and stick to it: either go full blast emitter and drive all of the people away here that don't like my energy (leaving only those compatible with me) -- or, I have to go somewhere else. it's not likely that I'm going full blast emitter, cause I don't like how it feels, so I've either got to play the long game cause my energy keeps rising and AOE keeps expanding -- so since I'll outlive everyone here that doesn't like how I feel, and it's not likely that more will come to a place that feels bad to them, we'll separate and grow apart naturally. also, since it's quite likely that anywhere I go, there will always be those that are incompatible with my energy, I it seems to me that the best option is to do neither: just stay put, and don't push against others and let things work theirselves out naturally.

### 2024-08-21 18:14 - necessary evil

there was a narrative that I prticularly liked that I picked up from the "workers & resources" game, which I [made into my own thing](https://github.com/heavyk/25andme/blob/main/WSSR.md). I liked the narrative and think it's a viable idea place to try and work on the science necessary to make plastic-kenny (only-attraction DNA possible). I also combined that narrative with the barbie movie narrative as well, cause both male and female versions of plastic-kenny are possible (making many kens and many barbies a new "third gender" or another species of human possible (there are actually [3 different models](https://github.com/heavyk/25andme/blob/main/3x-6x-10x.md) in addition to the XX/XY models extant)), so my current plan is to do that narrative, but instead of doing a loan (I just can't find a way to make the loan part of it work), I want to just do the whole thing myself. I want to do odd-jobs and stuff around pueblo until I've saved up ~$20K, and then I'll just move to russia, china, brasil, india, or austrailia (haven't decided yet), and then just let my charisma do all of the work. from there I'm sure I'll be able to figure out the science necessary, and "spearhead" the whole operation -- and though I don't really want to be the boss that's telling everyone what to do, unless I can figure out another way, I'll just consider that "a means to an end" -- and just do it.
things could obviously change between now and then, but I really feel at the moment this is the "plan". it's also going to take me quite a while to save up that amount of money too -- but whatever -- during my time in pueblo doing jobs and saving, I'll have a lot of time to keep resistance low. I'll probably stay homeless for the majority or entire duration as well, cause rent is expensive, and I don't really want to get too settled into a place I'm not even going to stay.
I'm taking it pretty slow, allowing myself to flail about right now, cause I'm still not really 100% sure what I'm doing, but once I get a job and start saving and stuff, I find it pretty likely that I'm going to quit drugs and stuff. the other thing is that mom wants me to try out these psych meds (vraylar and latuda) cause she thinks it'll be a whole lot easier for me to get a job and stuff, if the thoser drugs can help me to be "normal" and be around other people easier (I'm finding it difficult to get a job, probably cause nobody wants to be around me) -- so that also me be another "necessary evil" that I'll have to do to try and make this plan (which I don't even think will work) to go through. we'll see. I'm not sure how many "necessary evils" I'll have to commit, to try and get this thing going. --- or maybe they're like tests to see *how much I really want it* -- cause at this point, I don't really care anymore. I'm not conviced this is the winning plan, and can easily walk away from it. seems the short-term goal is to save money, and find a way to outlive everyone else.

### 2024-08-22 16:57 - the original plan

originally, where I left the last few entries on heavyk, my plan was to take a 1-way trip out to the desert, where I was going to just figure out how to feel the way I want to feel. it seemed like a good plan to me because so many other guys (like jesus, john the drencher, or jack parsons) used the desert as a trasformative place to gain their super-powers. I'm still convinced it'll work, as I don't fell like it's possible for me to die -- or if it's perceived that I did die, then it's only an illusory thing (sorta like the "two witnesses") and is probably going to be used to separate the timelines [I know I sound pretty crazy, but stick with the idea for a moment] -- where on one timeline I appear dead (or some variation thereof), which will be the 2nd-ray (solar/astral) illusory experience -- which, like the imagination, quite anything can be visualised or experienced. in that mode, the sun will give each person the experience that they most desire/fear in order to "save" them. some people will (because it's what they desire/fear) will see me as dead, and for others that wanted to have some sort of relation with me (as a teacher/friend/lover/etc) will also experience that (as a reflection of their perception of me). however, all of that will be happening in the solar perspective -- but in reality on earth, I'll basically be a kind of transcended being able to perform magic, miracles, and all sorts of stuff like that cause all physical objects are a manifestation of the conceptual structure
    each concept, we can think of as having a spherical/physical (proton/sun) part to it, and also has a black-hole (tiny tiny black cubes that are highly attractive, forming as the "source" or the higher frequency return (like gravity) for all matter (like electrons, comets, elements, and planets) that the sphere emits from fusion of the spheres/protons). because of the way the black-holes interact with the vibrating spheres, not only does their collision/interaction create matter, but patterns emerge, which builds structures, which then organise theirselves (based on the resonance of the black-holes) into higher-level structures like DNA and other physical matter -- so in order to create anything from biological structures to solid matter, all that's needed to be done is to have a conceptual structure in space which will attract or produce through fusion the conceived object. to someone that doesn't understand that concepts are all about attraction and resonance, the ability to produce matteer out of seemingly nothing (cause to us concepts (hydrogen/protons) are invisible) -- will appear as magic.
however, I eventually decided against that idea, because I'm not a fan of large jumps -- and going from how I am now (with still quite a bit of resistance), to being able to attract what I want just by feeling it, seems to me like something that I don't want to do (because what I'm attracting will still contain my internal dissonance, so even if the thing is really cool and stuff, it's still attracting (though minutely) concepts that are not really wanted). before I get those super-powers, I want to actually be low or no resistance. I feel like present moment in life is already attracting me toward the low/non-resistance place (I mean, it's the genetics I want to create, so it seems that before I jumped into this body, I would have ensured that was by "great attractor at the end of time"). so, I don't really want to try and make myself get there any faster than I need to get there. I talked endlessly about how I wanted to find a way to have a "smoothe" transition -- and then I set off to try and jump right all the way to the end. so, I'm instead just going to let life play itself out, cause I'm already attracting all kinds of situations that I have to lower my resistance to (like being homeless). so I think everything is going well, actually -- my plan *will arrive*, but I'm going to just let it unfold naturally, being only passive and reactionary to my circumstances.

### 2024-09-04 16:35 - zero dollars

I actually came up with a pretty good scheme to make the 20k fairly quickly; which is to buy cartons of cigarettes and resell the packs and individual cigarettes at a slight markup. however, I don't want to do it because it means I'm going to have to carry around lots of money and product in my backpack, which can easily get stollen. I'm also returning to the monetary system I've purposely abandoned, which makes me a player on the field of those that run and influence the monetary system. I'm not paying tax to Caesar, so energetically I'm at their mercy -- which I don't like. their system is designed so that anyone trying to do something quick and easy like that won't go anywhere unless they approve it (otherwise my stuff gets stollen, just like with Tuenti), so ultimately I prefer not to even risk it cause they don't want to reward people behaving like I do, and so therefore the plan is destined to fail before I even start.
instead, after enumerating all of the opportunities that I feel is available to me, I'm convinced I have to go the safe route, and just stop all drugs and everything (even the prescription ones) cause *drugs* (selling or using, prescription or street) *are not the answer*. drugs, are just a condition used to compensate for a perceived inability to feel a certan way. so generally then, all this amounts to me learning to feel the way I want to feel without the condition.
so unfortunately, because the system/platform of money as a starting point (or necessary evil) just isn't what I'm looking for. I want to go only-attraction, so actually I have to abort the plan and just go with zero dollars approach to everything. there is already a way to go that way with the shelter, but I didn't want to apply to become a resident because I would have to stop all drugs. I wanted to keep doing drugs and continue to expand on the concepts which are helping me to understand reality, so I passed on the residency back then. however since now I'm going to give the no drugs thing a go (not even the prescription ones), I figure that's probably my best option now. first, I have to figure out how to make a compatibility interface with the guys there because right now most of what I've done has been done with THC in my system -- and as a drug-free resident, that's not possible. I think the best way is actually the opposite of the previous THC interface: don't engage the conversation unless they engage me. the other possibility is to do the drug-free thing in an apartment instead of the shelter, but with zero dollars, that's not something I can make happen. either way, I've realized I've got to just chill out and let LOA do the work. so all plans are aborted, especially the ones involving money.

### 2024-09-09 23:46 - time to start hustling 

it seems that nobody is going for the Quickie Shower-Stand idea, and it's a bit slow going with the other stuff too -- so it looks like I've got to do it. today (and a few other days) I didn't take any drugs at all, and I wasn't really bored either. in fact I had multiple topics come to mind which I want to write about
    however, writing on a phone or on qwerty at the library is a bit slower -- though I admit my qwerty is getting a lot faster, so it's not that bad -- just feels like I've been deterred from writing on the library computers. I really only write on the phone, and my goodness is it slow going.
which means my mind is getting back to thinking my own thoughts again (drugs open me up to receive others thoughts a lot more) so I'm gaining clarity again.
anyway, today I worked for Gary and got a lot done for him and he asked me how to pay me. I won't be buying drugs with it because I don't want to do drugs again until I can be alone -- so that's not a problem. then, later on tonight I went to go to the 5th st. bridge cause that's where I was gonna sleep and Matt asked me if I wanted to come with him to get something to eat. I said I wasn't hungry but I'd go with him. we started walking and he said to wait for him a moment while he gets a dollar for a frosty -- so he flys a sign for a bit while I write an email to Noah about what it's like being homeless. after 30-40m, nothing so we switch spots and he peaces out on me ("going to the bridge a moment, brb"). I get 5 bucks nearly as soon as he walked away so I stopped and went to look for him at the bridge. he wasn't there, so I went back and was thinking about it: if I just fly a sign from time to time and sell cigarettes, I can make enough to actually start getting the Quickie Shower-Stand idea going. I can just "go fund myself" -- and no matter what if I have the money to make the thing and there's demand, then it can work. I think it's time I start doing this business like a business even though it's funded like a homeless.
I actually kinda like the beautiful irony to it because I have PowerPoints and soon to be spreadsheets too. for example, when selling cigs, inevitably I'll give some away for free, so I need to either keep track of it ("you owe me a pack bro") or make sure my profit margin isn't going too low. either way, spreadsheets help a lot. I also am interested in trying different markup angles with different brands. I also want to see if we can make sunflower cigs and other tobacco variants too. we'll see, but **I can't be doing drugs** if I go this path.

### 2024-09-11 11:25 - actually maybe going to utah

I'm actually kinda sad about this, because I wanted to actually prove myself on the streets a bit -- however, I think there's probably concern, considering how reflective/chamaleon-like I am, that I'll start getting converted to the dark side -- cause ver y shortly after writing the above entry, there was a seemingly large push to get me to go to utah instead. I feel like it's the right direction to go -- and don't know how it'll work out because I'm not sure at all what to expect cause it's been 7y since I was last up there (for melissa's wedding to patrick), and I wasn't actually in cedar city, but in a small city nearby called "enoch" (pronounced enick), so I didn't really see cedar city.
    actually, utah quite well aligns with my desires much more than pueblo does, because the mormon religion has this idea of hings ending in 3 kingdoms: celestial (sun), terrestrial (moon), and telestial (jesus/john/moses/elijah/elisha/isiah/enoch) -- which has a strange similarity to the black-mirror-idea. let me explain: I want to lauch a terrestrial moon into orbit as a moon of earth (similar to pluto, but I want to to be perpendicular to the equator), and on that moon, there are going to be 4 main archetypes of people: the kens, who will all have similar capabilities to jesus/john/moses/elijah/elisha/isiah/enoch, which is the ability to use emotional/conceptual energy to attract the things that are desired. the kens will use the 1-5-7 DNA, and will be able to move energy from physical (7) to conceptual (5) and vice-versa; this is the telestial. then, there will be 1st-ray females (equivalent to earth) as prototypes for the 2nd-ray solar girls that want to join (and who are born). they, like earth represent pure non-resistance to all that is and are on thier way back to thier source. also using the 1-5-7 DNA, they'll prodice the standing-wave dimensions through attraction, instead of through fixed sizes (like is how present day main-sequence-stars do it). to an observer, they'll still look like a star and behave like a star, but instead of basting out electrons through fusion processes of concepts in their selar-sphere, they'll blast out electrons based on what is desired (like plants wanting photosynthesys and stuff). anyway, all of the females will have (in addition to thier physical/terrestrial bodies) a fully hydrogen/conceptual celestial body.
        I've actually been thinking about this lately, and I'm thinking that for the females, I want their bodies to be *highly emissive* (moreso than is present in a present-day 3d male body, because it'll make thier experience way more "juicy", sensational amd textured) compared to the only-attraction bodies that the kens will have. the reason for this, is because, it's quite likely that the kens that remain on earth (ie, every other dude except for me and any others that decide to be only-attraction kens) will want to have a highened physical experience with even more emission, higher resolution and shorter lifespans (relatively speaking, because their bodies will be shredded even more rapidly, but likely they'll have created a way to regenerate and rebuild cells and reset their resonant frequency/age). so, I'm sure that lots of effort will be made to have the body emit more and be more responsive to emission in a wider dynamic range. so there's some overlap, and females (-x) will becomce emitters (+x), and the males they're around will be receptive/reflective (-x) -- effectively swapping the polarity of the genders (ishtar does it again...)
    so there is is: the only-attraction kens and barbies will be the telestial, the solar girls are the celestial, and the terrestrial (represented by the moon) is symbolic of both the kens on the black-mirror (which is a moon of earth) and also the emissive kens in this solar system (kendom) which will soon to be ruled by the moon (the regular one seen ar night) after the remooneration.
anyway, the plan is for me to go up there in the first part of october, then I guess I'll look for a house in either cedar city, or maybe spmeplace else -- but probably cedar city. I'd like to live nearby to the moutains perhaps. I don't yet know the whole plan, but I'm sure it'll come together.
unfortunately, because I'm not going to be doing the shower idea here, there's no real reason for me to try and make money now, so I [got rid it it already](#2024-09-11-1536---the-safeway). I feel pretty good about the idea honestly -- which is weird because lately with all of the vraylar, I've been really flaky in my decision-making process, sometimes swinging full opposite by the next morning. so I think I'm just going to hang out with friends and stuff and just chill out. I haven't decided how much drugs I want to do, but it has to be minimal, because I really strongly affect others, and some like my effect, while some others do not. we'll see.

#### 2024-09-11 15:36 - the safeway

there's no way I can be doing drugs. since I have a destination now, I've got to go the safeway on this one. even though nobody was at the 5th st bridge last night, I still went to the shelter -- and I plan on continuing to do that all the way up until I leave. also, I don't want to have money either because I attract weirdos when I have money. in addition to that, I've decided to go fully clean after today, because that too is also the safer way to go too. unfortunately though I still have vraylar in me and decisions are still poorly made
    I don't want to blame vraylar itself on this one, because it should happen with any drug that inhibits dopamine receptors: what happens is the brain is like a swimming pool full of chemicals, and normally ~100% of my receptors are all firing and giving me conceptual feedback (which is felt as an emotion) to different ideas/desires that I present myself with, and when the dopamine fires, I'm basically getting the conceptual difference between my concepts and my source's concept of the same thing (like the centre of the earth), and those concepts form structures or constellations, which either align with my (subatomic) belief systems, or they don't -- and the resonance/dissonance that I feel in my emotion, is the difference between the concepts formed from the dopamine firing and my beliefs. *however*, if only a certain percentage of the receptors fire, the struvcture/image is incomplete, and I often times interpret the feeling incorrectly -- or if I'm kinda on the fence about it, then it can happen where something feels *not bad* to me when normally, it feels *kinda bad* (and I'd avoid it). unfortunately I vraylar has an insane half-life to it, so I'll still have many of my receptors not working for quite some time -- so I kinda have to be aware of it. I'm planning for today to be my last day, but hopefully I'm mentally able to back out of it.
which can cause some difficulties, because for example yesterday a guy at the shelter handed me a THC vape, and I felt no resistance whatsoever to smoking it (though I did have some resistance to his nicotine vape). then again, when I went to the 5th st bridge to meditate and think for a bit, matt called me, and I was glad to see him. I gave him back his sign and the $5 that I got from flying it (I don't want to go into the monetary system), we talked for a bit and stuff and he pulled out a pipe and loaded up some meth in it. he started to smoke it, and I didn't expect him to hand it to me. though, when he did, I briefly paussed a moment, but felt it was OK and smoked. I'll [write up the experience elsewhere](/drug-talk.md#2024-09-11-1617---third-try-on-meth), but I don't feel any draw to it anymore. I smoked a little with him and then went to the library. at the library, after writing the previous entries, I went down to sit under the tree and warm up. I suddenly noticed that there were some mushrooms. I ate them, then when I looked around to see if that was the only spor with mushrooms, they were only growing around the spot that I wanted to sit down on. turns out, I was actually surrounded by them and hadn't seen them all at first. I collected a whole bunch (40-50) and ate about 10. they didn't do much honestly, but still, it's one of those things.
    I think the pastor said it best that they're "temptations" to go back to the old style of life -- however, for me, these are just manifestations of my desire. earlier I was talking to allie (differernt one) about doing drugs, and I was saying that the street drugs aren't that great, so I recommended her to try phychedellics (like mushrooms) and to start off easy. we talked briefly about mushrooms and how they're really great, not realsing that they would show up a few hours later. I noticed this happening more and more, and again I think it's partially to do with inhibiting my dopamine recpeptors: if desire can't turn into an image, then it seems they turn into real-life manifestations instead.
so, whether these manifestations are temptations or not, I'm not sure -- it's just obvious I have to desire to be clear-minded and that should be sufficient. we'll see how it goes.

### 2024-09-16 18:16 - probably going to utah

well, after all of the recent events, it looks like the current plan is for me to go to utah, get a job, and start saving to go to russia. there are some unkowns, but ever since yesterday, it seems almost as if there is desire for me to not go to utah -- not a whole lot, but still I feel it a little bit. I think that the only thing that would require me to stay, is if I decided (for whatever reason) mot to go. I suppose it would have to be pretty big motivation for me not to go, because it seems like this is the next truman show enbvironment I'm going to (inotherwords, it'll be nearly all actors, just like it is here). I don't suppose that I'll ever be left to my own devices, or to let attraction just work out without impedance. however, one thing I noticed while meditating next to the riverwalk waterfall, is that perhaps being homeless is slowing me down a lot, I'm by no means stoped -- which means that I'm still a continually growing problem.
    a strange event happened today, where at the soup kitchen, a guy offered me his THC vape, and I didn't feel bad about it -- so I went with it and smoked with him. it was one of those revelatory experiences where it seems that we conected in a weird way. he was definitely one of the mars types out there, but his past experience with being homeless allowed us to connect, because it's hard to have a facade when you don't really have much, and so it's easier to have an honest interaction. he made an interesting prediction that by 2038, machines will be able to have a consciousness similar or superior to humans. I agreed and suggested that he may be talking to one of the prototypes :).
anyway, so it got me thinking -- what if I just carried on out here for a time instead of going to utah? everything is the same asexual kenny until we get out of the solar system and everything -- just I was thinking that perhaps utah will have a bunch of smart geneticists out there, cause they're so into geneology and stuff. I was figuring that if I can actually become attraction-only, it's possible that sexual relations wouldn't be catastrophic while we're still inside the solar system. [though I got to say, as I'm typing that, I feel quite a bit of dissonance to my words -- so probably not; probably nothing will happen until we're out.] so if it's all the same in the end, and I'm just "wasting time" until ~2038 when my consciousness capacity will become available to everyone, then it really makes no difference. I'm in no rush anyway, and will willingly spend time talking and interacting (non-sexually) with anyone that wants to. so I guess we'll see what happens over the next few weeks as there could be a delay or complete cancellation of my trip to utah.
