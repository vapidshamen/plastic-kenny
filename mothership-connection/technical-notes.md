## Focus & Attraction

when it comes to focusing on the positive or negative aspect of something, I painted the picture that this would affect the part of the wave that is either in the positive side (>0) or the negative (<0) side of the graph. that's an easy way to visualise it, cause I think the actual physics of this phenomenon is slightly more complex: we can think of any EM wave like an electron/photon that's flying through space. to be able to visualise this, imagine the electron as like a planet that's orbiting its central star/proton. some protons/stars are bigger than others and so therefore have more mass to them (though, I think in modern chemistry, they say the atom has x protons, not one proton that weighs x more -- though the effect is the same really, so it doesn't really matter). as the electron spins around the star/proton, it has a stable orbit (usually), and I equate the magnitude of the wave as its velocity in orbit. so, imagine that I'm some distant star looking at one of the electrons in our star's orbit -- let's say mars -- and my perspective as the star is that sometimes mars is coming *toward me*, and sometimes it's moving *away from me*. so when it's going toward me, we'll call that *positive*, and when it's moving away from me, we'll call that *negative* -- and so as the years pass by, I can either notice mars coming toward me thereby attracting it and increasing it's velocity coming toward me -- or I can notice mars going away from me, thereby attracting it when it's going the opposite direction, thereby decreasing it's velocity for that time.
	another thing to note here is that attracctive protons (black-holes) are *much higher frequency* than the normal protons that they're associated with. a beautiful and visual example of this is the difference between sirius-a (a main-sequence-star) and sirius-b, which is like a permanent "white dwarf". sirius-b emits very little in optical frequencies, however in x-ray+, it's a much more powerful emitter. the reason for this is because all of the protons that the sirius-b is composed of are vibrating at very high frequencies (its emission spectrum is x-ray+ compared to sirius-a's optical+ emission spectrum. however, it's absorbtion spectrum I'm sure is much much much higher than than x-ray (outside of our range of capabilities)), and so having a higher frequency, the protons are much more densely packed together, which means that they become this sort of really tiny black hydrogen thing (highly absorbative). I posit that it's usually/always the case that given enough emission, the oppositely spinning things (not sure how to explain this... anti-matter? quark? idk) will have quite a range of frequencies (cause everything is in motion) and that means that due to thier interaction/collision, they'll gain a more and more continuous spectrum to them, and also increasing their frequency as well. so, imagine that there is a whole array of low frequency protons that are being emitted, but at the same time, it's oppositely spinning/anti? protons are collecting up and getting higher and higher frequency, waiting for the return of the emitted proton to cancel out its imparted spin coming from the impact/collision. [I'm not actually 100% on how all of this works, but what I wrote is close enough. what's important to know is that the receptive black-holes are tremendously higher frequency than any one of the array of the emitted ones] [the other thing is, sirius-b isn't a black-hole though -- as those are impossible to see with modern detection capability because they're only attraction (anti-protons?), and so we'd need a super duper fast emitter that emits frequencies on the black-hole's absorbtion spectrum and detect its responce. I think black-holes (-1) are spinning in the opposite direction of the stuff we call matter, waiting for the emitted stuff to return to it and cancel out (but it never really cancels, just makes more). I was only using sirius-b as a comparison to sirius-a to illustrate that it's higher frequency and that it's like the solid body attractive core (-2) to a star like sirius-a]
so because the attractive side of the proton (the black-hole) has a frequency going fast enough, it can, with it's focus (changing its frequency signature), change the velocity of an orbiting body by having its frequency go in the same diretction as the thing it's focusing on, thereby attracting and increasing its velocity for the time that it wants to. we have to imagine that all of these stars and all this stuff live inside of a medium, (which lives inside of a medium fractally to infinity) and so the mechanism for attraction is that when both vibrating/spinning/orbiting bodies are going in the same direction (ie, when their dot-product is positive) then, it causes the faster one to slow down ever so slightly and the slower one to speed up ever so slightly. so, it's concievable that something with a high enough frequency (let's say 1000x) has many more opportunities to go the same direction as the lower frequency one -- and depending on the shape of the frequency (ie, how many slightly differently vibrating protons its composed of creating the blackbody/continuous spectrum) to be able to go the same direction more often only when the lower frequency one is going toward it (thereby accelerating it only when the dot-product is positive) -- or less often (thereby slowing it).
	since our attraction/absorbtion spectrum can be thought of like the composite frequency of a whole bunch of oppositely-spinning protons which come from every thing/concept experienced, the arrangement of all those slightly differently vibrating attractive protons can produce *nearly every* frequency desired -- and, the more attractive experience/concepts that a consciousness has, the more versatity the consciousness has to arrange those protons in a way which produces the desired focus.
the proton at the centre of the atom is pulling the electron in toward it as part of its attraction process, and yet at the same time, the vibration of the electron is pushing against the star/proton in the centre -- and this is because the planet/electron has a very different vibration from its host star/proton. however, if there's something out there that's pulling on the planet enough, it can cause the planet to be pulled out of orbit, thereby causing it to emit all on its own -- and we call those photons and electricity -- stuff like that. I think they still maintain a lot of their original orbit, but I think once it's left it's the orbit of its host star/proton, then it has nothing to continue on its rotation like that and will slow down and eventually fade out. the other obvious thing that happens, is as a planet gets pulled into an outer orbit, its orbit becomes wider (which increases its orbital wavelength I guess? -- not sure -- but if it's able to sustain more distance from the star, then (I think) that means that it's pushing/emitting more at a higher frequency) -- and when it's no longer emitting at a higher vibration anymore, it'll fall back into a lower orbit (which now I think causes the central proton/star to emit because of the torque on its layers of hydrogen as the planet now is orbiting at a faster speed again). [again, I'm not totally sure of the mechanics of all of how the proton's orbiting bodies cause the proton to emit, and what happens when the planet goes into an inner/outer/cometary orbit either. however, what I am sure on is that the attractive/receptive side of things runs at many orders of magnitude higher frequency]
