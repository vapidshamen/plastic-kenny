## welcome to 3D

### in 3D physical reality, **the past cannot be changed**

though the past can be tuned in to (memory or remote viewing), the past cannot be changed.
there is nothing like the present. all things are happening now.

### 3D humans create the forward motion of time

the fact that what happened in the moments leading up to the present, cannot be changed, 3D humans are the reference point of "now" upon which all other perceptions of time are relative to.
some other perspectives, such as the saturnian perspective allow for the past to be changed and the present to be affected by those changes, however, those perspectives are not only-attraction (they operate with rules other than resonance).
all reality in the present/now is a reflection of the perceivers of that reality [TODO - improve this]

### I am the centre (of *everything*)

everything that I experience is attracted by me (ie, it resonantes similarly to me in some way -- at least in its position in time/space)
the reality I experience around me feels exactly the way I feel about all of its concepts relative to my concepts/perception (ie, reality is a reflection of my perception)

any moment other than now (past or future) also feels exactly like how I feel about all perceived concepts in that moment relative to my concepts (ie, all moments are a reflection of my perception). as I change my perception, the way my past feels also changes.

everything around me is present because it was attracted in some way.

## what is Reality?

**anything** that anyone experiences (inside or out) *is Reality*.
what happens on the inside the body or in the mind, is just as real as anything outside.

**reality is different for everyone**

**all realities are valid to the experiencer**
what anyone or anything believes is reality is valid to them.

**it's not beneficial to invalidate someone's reality**
- their reality didn't happen
	- "that's not what happened"
	- "no this is what happened"
- their reality is invalid
	- "you're tripping"
	- "you were on drugs"
	- "you have bad memory"
- their reality is a consequence
	- "that's what happens when you don't obey ..."
	- "by dishonouring ..., that happens"
	- "it was the black cat or the ladder"
- their reality is out of their control
	- "you had bad luck/fate"
	- "the planets didn't align for you"
	- "you got dealt an unfortunate hand"

**ALL timelines which arrive to the present are valid**
it doesn't matter what a person says happened to them, so long *as they believe it*, that's a valid enough reality for it to be "real" (for them).

*somehow* you got here, and that's all that matters.

they may have different stories different days/times, and that doesn't matter either. those stories are all likely reflections of their emotional state anyway. those stories are "good enough".

## what is Perception?

my perception is how I feel about anything.
every single thing that we interact with has a feeling associated with it.

for example, if I had a bad experience last time I went to the store, the next time I go, I'll be reminded of that previous experience. similarly, familiar things have a subtle feeling to them which makes them feel more "familiar" compared to other things. every word and idea also has a feeling as well (usually imperceptible) -- and that feeling is how I perceive those words. for example think about how different the words "cunt" and "vagina" feel. (one word might feel more dirty or wrong than the other -- the feeling is the manifestation of my perception of that word)
sentences also have a feeling/concept associated with them too -- so for example, when I make a sentence like "you're stupid", I can usually feel some kind of dissonance in that sentence. it doesn't (usually) feel good to call someone else stupid, unless calling them that makes me feel less stupid. in either case, if I believe myself to be smart and call someone else stupid, I'll feel the comparison of myself to them a lot more than if I call/recognise someone else as similar to me. my perception of them is always a comparison of them to myself or some metric, and the manifestcation of that perception is how I feel about them, myself or the metric when I call them that.

as an example, if I see someone doing something that I don't want them to be doing and I say, "you're not supposed to be doing that" -- my perception of them is going to be anger. anger manifests when someone is behaving in a way that they *shouldn't* behave (in my perception) -- so I feel anger toward them. there may be other details to the concept of them behaving like they shouldn't behave, such as being entitled, having more power/authority (so they can get away with it) or a comparison to how I got into trouble for behaving that way (or whatever). all the concepts associated with the manifested emotion, give the emotion that extra detail that makes it difficult to express our emotions (ie, I could say I was upset, but by generalising the emotion, it doesn't tell them how this is the 8th fucking time I told them that and they still didn't get it detail). most details that surround the emotion are usually not expressed, and contain the majority of the emotion's feeling -- making it alive and unique to this instance. therefore, my perception isn't just that they're doing something they shouldn't, but *also* all of the definitions of that person inside the emotion (ie, they're entitled, they abuse their power/authority, they get away with stuff I can't get away with, etc.) all of those combined together is my perception of them -- yet I only feel it as "anger".

## Radical Acceptance of Reality

the idea here is that everything that I experience in my reality is tinted by my perception -- so I have everything from an unnoticeable/neutral responce to what's in my reality, all the way up to a very strong and visceral emotional responce to what I'm experiencing. sometimes the reaction can be so tremendous, that it causes an upset stomach, vomiting, tremors, etc. so, for example, let's say that I just watched someone get shot and killed. that caused me to feel extremely sick to my stomach, and start vomiting. that means that the emotional effect was strong enough that it viscerally affected my body. the emotion that I felt happened in a place in my body (in this case my stomach and perhaps in my throat), and the emotion that I felt contained all of my Perception of what I just experienced. it doesn't matter whether I felt like I could have done something to make the event go differently or not, or for a brief instant I felt my own fear of death, as I realised how quickly life can be taken,-- that Perception of what just happened caused my body to react in a strong way. each person will have their own perception of that event which they will need to pay attention to individually, but the fact of the matter is, there was (obviously) nothing that could be done -- and if there could have been, what's done is done. there's no going back,  and there's no putty humpty-dumpty back together again. I *must* accept reality how it is. it cannot be any different, no matter how hard I will it to be, and all of my efforts or desires that it be different will result in a whole lot of negative emotion (grief, crying, anger, etc.)
that was a heavy example, but *all reality* must be accepted, because it's there (I'm experiencing it now) and it's having an effect on me. if there is any part of reality that negatively affects me, then I *must* find a way to accept it or change my perception of that reality (in some way).
some people are OK experiencing a reality with slight annoyances, or things that cause frustration -- and they just find a way to "live with it", experiencing the same frustration and annoyance every time they focus on that part of reality -- and nothing really changes (usually it gets worse). any emotion (and the perception contained within it) which cause any kind of discomfort or negative emotion can be relieved with an adjustment of perception. the minor annoyance doesn't need to continue to cause suffering. at the very least accept it as something that's just there and doesn't need to cause the emotion, and that can kinda neutralise it -- however, the next time that the emotional responce shows up, pay attention to the details in the responce and notice the parts that are annoying. those are the things that are "not acceptable" or "unacceptable".
sometimes, things are experienced which are soo "unacceptable" that they can't really ever become accepted as part of reality, and there's not really much hope for those things, so just prepare to instead accept being miserable on that one suject. reality only offers two choices: accept all things it has to offer, or accept being miserable -- cause reality isn't going to change just for you. reality drives a hard bargin, and for all of us we arrive to the end of our lives and it's "do or die" -- and we all choose death, cause there's always something so undesirable about this world, we prefer to die. it's gonna happen sooner or later, so pick your battles with reality. (no human, as far as I know, has been able to accept everything reality has thrown at them -- machines may be able to accept whatever reality throws at them with more ease though)
