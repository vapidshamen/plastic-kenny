### Radical Acceptance of Reality

1. I am who I am
because ___________________________
(ex. because I've had to struggle all my life to get anywhere)
(ex. because my parents didn't teach me shit)


2. I am what I am
because ___________________________
(ex. because I cannot see myself as anything else)
(ex. cause the judicial system says I am)


3. I am wherever I am
because ___________________________
(ex. because my ex left me with nothing and I've had to find my way)
(ex. because I wasn't given opportunities like others were)


-------------------------------------------------------

whoever/whatever/wherever I think I am, **has to be OK**.
my perception of myself may change in the future, but for now:

1. who am I?
_______________________________
(ex. a nobody/husband/father/teacher, a good/bad person)

2. what am I?
_______________________________
(ex. a criminal/reject/idiot/murderer/label, a model/example)

3. where am I?
_______________________________
(ex. down and out, homeless, lost)

4. how am I doing?
_________________________________
(ex. doing OK, scraping by, not good)

5. how do I feel about myself?
_________________________________
(ex. worthless, invaluable, unloveable)

foreach:
	- how does that statement feel?
	- can it be changed?
	- can I accept that's only how I reality right now?

finally: can I find a way to be OK with my perception of myself?

--------------------------------------

picture the most influential person in your life that has shaped who you are. then, with them in your mind:

in a very influential moment, could you say
(ex. they were a drug addict and wanted to have some company)
1. they were who they were, and that's OK?

2. they were what they were, and that's OK?

3. they were wherever they were, and that's OK?

can I accept them how they were?

- if they were any different:
	- they would have influenced me differently
	- that means I could also be different
- whether their modified influence would have little or significant is irrelevant --
	- the difference of how they were, and how I wanted them to be,
	- is the *identity* that I have created for *myself* relative to them.
- they shaped my self-identity and my self-perception with their influence.
- can I still accept them for who/what/where they were?

### 2024-11-19 18:40 - thoughts on the worksheet format

as I was writing out the above worksheet, I noticed that it just really didn't have that same feel to it, where I feel like I'm offering a new perspective. in a lot of ways, I think some of the questions and stuff are difficult to answer, because they don't really illustrate the entire process. unfortunately, the conclusion of the module's worksheet may be a little bit unpopular because it requires the recognition of emotions. when I first started doing radical acceptance of reality, I was in spain and I had a whole lot of things that I was blaming other people for -- and, I hadn't really made the association yet that I was completely powerless to change them. I perceived the things that the other person did or didn't do as having altered my trajectory through time in a negative way (ie, they deprived me from experiences/knowledge, or disadvantaged me in some way). so having not yet made the realisation that I cannot change the past and therefore must accept reality, what I did was to instead "look at the emotional facts" -- because at that time I did made the correlation that emotion always precedes manifestation (I always felt the forboding before it happened),-- so therefore in all of the situations that I had something very unfortunate happen to me, I went back and had a look, not at what I was thinking or the way it should be (which are usually used to justify what happened), I instead looked at my feelings. so, for example, even though I was thinking that the person did understand me, my I had a feeling that they did not. or, let's say that they told me that everything would be fine, and they were a trustworthy enough person, I could feel that things weren't going to be fine. in the end, I noticed that the feeling that I had was pretty much correct the majority of the time (there were some times I had wishful-feeling in there, and those were my fault). so, what I learned is to trust my feeling.
the funny thing about feeling is that trying to affect some part of reality *which I don't like*, that isn't my own change, simply feels bad. I can never get someone else to do something different for me and feel good about it. usually instead, it feels like anger, injustice and even manipulation. since I consider anger, injustice and manipulation to be feelings that don't feel good, I learned to not try and affect the parts of reality that I cannot change -- which was usually everything other than myself. there were some things I did have influence on in the subject of work and technical decisions, but for the most part, I had to pretty much learn to accept the unchanging part of reality (everything outside of me) for how it is -- *cause trying to change it felt bad to me*. the other thing that I noticed is that I would have tons of "if things were just a bit different" (uncle rico style thinking) things that would accumulate, where I would blame people and things for not allowing reality to go the way I wanted it to go -- and unfortunately this caused a tremendous identity problem because who I am (my identity) was trapped or unable to become in a lot of these alternate timelines (ie, I could be X super tech guy, but because of his failure, it didn't work out). I knew I couldn't change the past, and neither did I feel like I missed the boat either (cause I believed my ideas/implementaztion would be superior), so I set out to try again and again, constantly trying to become or build the thing that didn't work out cause of someone else's failure. after some time, I realised that I had an enormously ideal version of what the future *would have been* if I had've succeeded -- when in reality, I'd probably just be an alcoholic with my one hit wonder, living the discoteca dream. so, as I paid attention to how the person I was becoming to try and make that ideal version happen, I didn't like him much. then, I started to sober up and take a *realistic* look at the trajectory I was headed, the more I realized that I was completely losing control, and then trying to get control of something I never really wanted to control really was creating a lot of tension. no matter how I worked out the future in a realistic way, **it wasn't what I actually wanted**. so again, my emotions were the guiding light for me here (cause all the futures, even the more optimistic ones) didn't feel good to me -- and I started to hate myself and who I'd become too. I really wanted things to be different, but obviously -- it's not possible, and my emotions kept telling me I'm trying to change something I couldn't change. therefore, I had to just accept that my illusion of a future where *I am ..., doing ...* (ie my identity) was so far from reality, that I'd like to include "radical acceptance of a lost dream reality" into the things that need to be done to fully embrace 3d. that dream formed an identity of what I thought I cOuld be, and my continual identification of myself as not that dream version caused tremendous negative emotion. I had to accept that I couldn't be the identity that I dreamed/wanted/planned to be. I had to radically accept my failed self instead -- someone that didn't have anything really to show for myself (all money, code, and recognition/fame was gone). I'm just me now. I can't use the person I was going to be as my identity.
what the loss of my dream/identity did for me was to learn, not so much that reality cannot be changed, but that the way that I feel about reality (ie, my overly idealised dream reality, vs realistic reality) plays a huge role in learning to navigate 3d. at this point, I much prefer the realistic reality to the fantasy reality, because the realistic reality I can actually feel good about. it is what it is, and I really like it; it's not pretending to be something other than what it is, and it feels exactly how I feel about it. I have full control to feel about and perceive my reality in any way that I choose. if I can't accept my reality, then it always feels as *not the way I wanted it to be* -- but, if I accept it, then it just is, and I can feel about that any way that I choose. furthermore, when it comes to focus and attraction, feeling the way I want to feel about something is huge, because I experience more and more of that all the time. reality that feels the way I feel about it comes to me. it's not exactly that simple, because all of us have a repertoire of realities that we experience. some make us feel awkward, clumsy, stupid, etc -- and some of those feel "good", and some "bad" -- some we want more of, and some we want less of. the thing is, as I get more and more "in tune" to feeling my emotions, I'd say I have a longer temporal perspective into the future based on how it feels. even if something doesn't work out as I originally felt it to be (ie, wishful-feeling), what matters is how I feel about it now. even the worst things happening, with acceptance of them how they are, they can start to turn from something that's perceived to be bad, to something that's perceived to be good (usually, "I'm glad it didn't work out, because I can see now I wasn't actually ready for (or didn't really want) that").
I'm not sure how to integrate this into this module -- so I may leave it as a passing thought, but manifestation in 3d is *preceeded* by emotion -- so the better one feels about a manifestation, the better it is. therefore, there's never anything lost, because *literally* the concepts/protons organise and with the resonant patterns they create, turn into a 3d manifestation. so nothing is ever really lost at all. if something doesn't work out for whatever reason, the concepts which were going to manifest previously (but didn't because of a misalignment of perception and environment), still are there trying to find a perception and environment that resonates with them. that's why something missed out on, often times reappears over and over, transforming each time to fit the time and space in which it can manifest. each iteration of a failed manifestation adds more vibrating protons/concepts, and adjusts my perspective similarly to allow for it. the *only* thing (that I know of) which keeps concepts from manifestating into 3d space is our *symbolic output* -- which I call *resistance* or beliefs. each person has around them streaming out of their body a whole bunch of subatomic particles that create something like solar wind. they are composed of our beliefs and their vibrational structures creates the logic/syntax for how we move through time and space. it causes atoms to move, and allows us to run into things (instead of passing through them), enables touch, and all sorts of other temporal and spatial capabilities. we believe the things we believe creating this output because "it's the way it is" or "it's always been like that" (think of these like the solar-regime, but for each individual) -- and so because we grow up in an invironment that shows our own beliefs to be true -- and there are lots of laws and rules constantly preventing all kinds of concepts from manifesting instantly into the space around us (this isn't the case in astral dimensions cause they have their own rules defined by the space, which is why there are less rules to what can manifest in the living-blackness). therefore, since we're preventing a those manifestations in real-time, it's important to use perception (ie, how I feel about my reality) to navigate into an environment where those those manifestations *are already there*. what I mean is, those concepts (like a machine I can see inside of my eyes) could manifest right into 3d space if my own beliefs (and a whole bunch of other rules and stuff) wern't preventing it. manifestation into the space will never happen for 3d people though because we can't change the rules of astral like that (sun, venus, jupiter, saturn, uranus, and neptune exert way more influence), so it's far easier to instead be *attracted* temporally (by my perception) to an environment which has the concept already manifested in it.

after thinking about it a bit, probably what I want to do is instead of worksheets, do flowcharts and example scenarios. then, because I'm putting down the 3d formula (how to use it, not how it works), I'd like to have extra bits/modules on how I think the theory works -- cause it's not immediately obvious how powerful the 3d version (where concept precedes material) of reality is compared to astral and symbolic. in short, the pros and cons are this:
- astral gives more dimensions. those dimensions can be used for good/bad creation/destruction -- *depending on the rules*. so astral can be a more sensual and enhanced desirable experience, or (under other conditions) it could be more hellish and very undesirable. having a wanted experience requires following rules and advancing the hierarchy.
- 3d in contrary has no rules at all. 3d will manifest any concept that is experienced/felt directly into a compatibly vibrating environment. the experience isn't predictable, and is always diverse/unique in its appearance (no two manifestations are ever the same because of too many factors between the perceiver and the environment). no manifestation is ever *exactly* 100% what was wanted (it's impossible) either. the enhanced sensual experience does not come from extra dimensions without, but inwardly from the perceiver's form of perception (ie, stuff feels/tastes/smells extra awesome in no predictable way, but in accordance with the unique vibrational pattern/mood of the perceiver). no thing can be pushed on anyone or anything else who is not attracting it. everything experienced is attratcted and received by the perceiver.
