## 2026-01-28 06:39 - iliad and the conscious universe

I just watched [the conscious universe](https://youtu.be/dkzr5A8IlLA) where he combines philosophy of kant/hagel to explain synchronicities in reality and how we collectively create reality together. it's a pretty good way of looking at -- and I'd never really thouht about or had the illustration that the vortex coming out of the top of our head combines with the vorticies of others heads (imagine we're all standingg as equals on an infinite plane [which is a visualisation that I love because I always think in infinite dimensions, so it would never occur to me to set everyone as equals on a line/plane, where the distance between us on the line is simply our vibrational resonance -- but then the vorticies above us interact in a *temporal* manner, because the circular motion of the vortex creates interactions/resonances that are periodic]). though we're all down together on the material plane, the higher we go up in the vertical direction, there are higher and higher frequency entities (temporal intersections like synchronicites, events on the horizon, then minor gods, gods (ie, zeus, ares), principals (ie, virtue, justice, beauty, aesthetics), then fundamental forces (ie, gravity, math, symbolic logic, attraction) -- and the collection of all these these vibrations creates a moment in time, the universe in an instant (which has an obvious calculatable next state -- but the calculation of such a thing would only be an approximation cause of the sheer quantity of all things). therefore, each thing in the universe, a resonant part of the whole universe is itself something like a hologram of the whole universe.
	there are some interesting implications to this conception of the universe though, which is that the next vibration is *theoricially* calculatable as a product of the interference of all the vibrations, we could in fact think of the universe as predetermined and having a pre-ordained trajectory to it, the infinite precision that any single consciousness would need to calculate the totality of all that vibration (considering that consciousness itself is vibration), means that it's not actually possible for the the next state of the universe to actually calculated but only approximated. that's pretty cool, because that means that tiny fluctuations in vibrations which are out of the estimating capabilities of the m6st expansive consciousnesses in the universe (or even the cOnsciousness of the universe itself) are what gives rise to free-will: the ability for us to defy predictions/estimations and take things a different way. [in fact, that's such a fun concept for m5 think about because even the most enlightened alien races (if they exist) are never able tto actually approximate/predict the trajectory of the universe with probable certainty; it could go some way that's unexpected -- lol (I wonder if the aliens are control freaks) cause even zeus and the greater gods are sujected to these higher frequency fluctuations -- lol]

anyway, so brilliant analogy aside, I actually wanted to write about the iliad and stuff and then I think I had some questions [though I can't remember them regarding this suject -- but I definitely have a bunch about many of the other topics].
as I was looking up andromache, wiki said that her name is a composite: andro (man) + o (transition/to) + mache (fight/battle). her story is that she's from persia (thebes), and in a previous war hector sacks her father's city and she becomes hector's prize of war. though you think she would be pretty upset about getting taken from her fatherland, by a foreign invader, she seems to really love hector and (although she's persian) becomes fully into the trojan way. later on achilles goes and sacks her city and kills her father and 7 brothers (meaning that by the end of the iliad, achilles has killed her father, brothers, and also her husband).
now, for some context, the beginning of the iliad begins with a conflict between achilles and agamemnon over briseis, whos name means "daughter of someone to be found" (ie, a prize of war) -- and so when the conflict emerges between achilles and agamemnon over this prize of war.
the layers of the iliad are quite amazing because even in the names of the characters, there's complex nuance which describes values that homer seems to be pulling out of the geist at time: andromache is a wonderful woman that a nobel fighter (hector) acquires as a prize of war -- and she's the thing that so many young boys will want (the model of the desirous prize) and so her name literally takes on the action (men to fight) of her description of desire (so that (if they can emulate hector's noble character), they can attain an andromache-like prize of war) -- and so to setup the desire further, this epic tale starts out with two arrogant men fighting over a prize of war (daughter of someone to be found) -- but because they're arrogant and not like hector (who will die at the end) don't really deserve such a prize -- which gives the reader the sense that if they could not act like the bad example (agamemnon or achilles before his change of heart), then they can get a prize like andromache.
	interestingly, the words also support this idea too, as κᾰλλῐ́μᾰχος (noble fighting) is κάλλος (beauty, noble) + μᾰ́χη (fighting) -- and the word has multiple feelings to it like "the beauty of fighting" (fighting for glory, honor, and pride of the faction/nation), "fighting for beauty" (grotesque imagery followed by sexual incentives of prizes, where the prizes reflect your nobility), "fighting with noble character" (fighting for the noble/right reasons), and "fighting fairly" (not cheating or manipulating odds in your favour) -- and the fair fighting concept is refinforced with another word: Νικόμαχος (battle with advantage/victory) which is νῑ́κη (victory/winning/advantage) + μᾰ́χη (battle) -- so here advantage is conflated with victory -- so you want to find a way to have a *noble advantage* -- so you can be κλειτός (famed/admired/glorified -- but also regarding their excellent skill). what this word implies, is that to get glory, fame, and to be admired, you have to be *noble/fair* in how you fight -- and the better your reputation is, that instantly converts into skill. this effect is all throughout the iliad where fame and glory of a fighter are directly proportional to their skill, so accumulating a positive opnion of others about you will naturally increase your skill (and probably the way you're perceived, the mind of the universe will proves their skill advantage as true, just like priam was able to just walk in because of the resonant concepts)
therefore to be κλειτός (someone of a famed/renowed fight), you are get into the greek circular game of fighting nobly to acquire fame which then results in more skill, which then results in more fame, which ultimately makes you famous and glorious (with the top guys gaining eternal glory being recorded in famous poetry like the iliad) -- so, fight for beauty, nobility, and virtue -- which makes the downfall of athens later on (when they're essentially bullying others to protect their reputation and status while still pretending to uphold beauty and virtue).
OK, a question comes to me now: so if homer outlines the greek game of fighting for virtue and nobility which expands fame and glory for the player, the game essentially proves itself to be a sham at the end because the unseen effect is that doing anything for status and position in other people's (think reality TV here) eyes ultimately makes the whole thing about attaining status, which is ultimately destroys the civilisation. since it seems that so many civilisation models/games seem to result in the aquisition of glory/status (individual or collective), what could be a way to construct a civilisation game which doesn't ultimately result in collection of status?
	a thought that comes to mind here, is that the individual (though the individual as a concept is still very primitive in the iliad) seeks status and position in comparison with others. the whole definition of the individual is that they are different or set apart from the rest (ie, this is "me", and that is "them") -- which in itself requires at least a defintion (what is me and what do I resonate with) and a comparison (what's the difference between me and the rest) -- so perhaps it's not possible to have a societal game where the individual exists which does not result in accumulation of status (because the definition of the individual requires a comparison, which then implies position in space, which then implies status)
