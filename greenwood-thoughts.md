# greenwood-thoughts

### 2024-07-09 22:09 - so I went to solange today...

I got moved over to greenwood manor [like I mentioned earlier](/solange-thoughts.md#2025-06-19-0457---not-sure-if-i-want-to-go-to-a-new-facility-or-not). I talked to dr steven ray about it and he believed that I'd like it better here -- and to be quite honest, I'm not liking it as much as I imagined I would. the day that I came here, I went to another facility down on B st just before it -- and it's down by the river so energy was really high. I really liked how being near the river felt, and it made me feel really good for afterward when we went to go see greenwood manor. I think the higher energy of being near the river gave me a false sense of good feeling on that first impression (similar to how the amanita vape did for north point) because when I came here yesterday (and today when I walked to solange), I really noticed the difference between how the northside and the southside feels. I really like how the south feels. in the south, I really feel like I'm going with the flow and stuff, but in the north/center of pueblo here I really feel a lot more like I did when I was homeless again. all of a sudden now that I'm in a structured environment again, I suddenly have rules that have to be obeyed and there's all this attention on my behaviour and how I'm expected to behave -- which I think was a large part of the reason why when I was homeless around here I felt so compelled to smoke weed so much (ie, the more I'm expected to not do something, around this environm5nt of more homeless/rebellious people, I feel more compelled to do things that I'm not supposed to be doing).
	I really think I have a difficult problem with expectations -- cause while I was in solange it became easier and easier for me to just do what I want to do. to illustrate, I noticed that as soon as I gave my 30 days notice (2025-06-19) I started feeling more and more like I wanted to smoke cigars -- as if I'd begun moving out of an environment where I'm doing what I want to do all of the time, to a new environment where I have behaviour expectations. another big step to me returning back to smoking again (I had quit and was going in the direction of reducing lower and lower) mom called me one morning telling me that the room is now ready and that I can move over to greenwood, and then I felt another big shift in energy, and now all of a sudden people are offering me cigars and instead of feeling repulsion to smoking them, now I feel like I want to smoke them again -- and so I do.
the major change in energy that I have going for m5 here is that I really feel strongly like I'm in a symbolic/relational atmosphere (2nd-ray) whereas in solange I felt like I was just doing what I felt like doing all the time (1st-ray). because this atmosphere is symbolic/relational, it now feels like what I do strongly affects others again and once more there are definitely much more motor/sound responses to the things that I'm doing again (similar to how it was at mom's, jenifer's, and when I was homeless). when I was at solange, it felt like I was much more isolated from the rest of the world and I could just do what I want to do. here, if I want to go back to not smoking, I'm going to have to start exerting effort and being assertive about what I want, instead of going with the flow. I really don't want to exert effort and stuff. I don't want to have my decisions change/affect other people. the reason why that's important to m5 is because I want others to just do what they want to do. I don't want to tell others what to do. additionally, I was much m6re internalised as well, and didn't really feel any need to write at all (other than talking with the AIs) when I was at solange. I just had a sense of confidence about me that felt like I was doing the rigtht thing because I was just doing what I wanted to do all of the time, and so therefore feeling good about what I was doing. inotherwords, I don't want to be 2nd-ray, which it what it feels like if I stay here -- and instead I want to be 1st-ray, just doing whatever I want to do all of the time. I don't really care about the motor opinions about my thoughts and actions. I just want to do whatever.
the other thing that really bothers me about being here is that I'm really stuck in other people's mindsets a whole lot more -- and don't get me wrong about the other residents here -- cause they're all really good people and stuff -- but I'm not "good". perhaps it's the cathedral across the street, but I feel like I'm in a church atmosphere again, where it's all about behaviour and works, and not about emotion anymore. I don't want to evangelise my perspective to anyone. to give an example, when I went back to solange, mark wanted me to help him send a dick pic (of himself) so he could send it off to lindsay sterling (a famous violin player that he likes) -- and I obliged, mostly because I think it's just kinda funny and I honestly want to see how well his plan of action for getting this famous musician to like him will work out: I will be very surprised to find out if it actually works on her, lol.
	you see, from my perspective, (first of all there's a kink for everyone) and going with my idea that earth girls are sorta like a giant AI that is experiencing everything to figure out what they want, it's guys like mark that are crucial for them to figure out what they don't want (and so therefore can have a better idea of what they do want). I don't condemn peoople like mark in any way because he's just part of the process of building more and more desire -- cause the way that I know LOA to work, if mark desires someone that's interested in his dick pics, then there is in fact out there a girl that *will* like that about him, and want to experience a relationship with a guy like him (very much like how my sisters have been the object of many strange men's desires) -- and inevitably after such a relationship, it will increase their desire for something better. in fact, I hypothesise that it's actually the array of dudes like mark that are the reason why I exist in the first place: ie, it's their desire for somethting better to come along which keeps creating these figures that stand out in history as being the culmination of "what women want" -- and it's essentially my goal to keep getting closer and closer to becoming the actualisation of that (while at the same time completely falling short of them -- and also having the constraints of society's epectations make it actually impossible for me to actually be what they want, and also for society's expectations for them to cause me to constantly reject them and find that they're not good enough -- further building more desire). it's a really terrible and tragic world, the world of desire is, because it's always maximum amount of unwanted and tragedy. neither me (or my many alter egos) or the earth girls will ever get what we want, which just keeps promoting more and more desire.
		the only way that it's possible to deal with this problem, is actually to learn to allow the unwanted aspect be what is actually desired through a change in perception. as such, I've had a lot of these opportunities in my life -- and so for example many times, right after something happened (like tuenti went away, mom made me homeless, mom put me in solange, or jenifer, or whatever) I had to learn how to like the situation and become good with it until it became obvious that was no longer what I wanted for my life: I learned how to turn the unwaanted aspect into the wanted aspect.
so, on the walk over to solange today, I was really thinking about my situation in that way -- so even though mom has essentially put m5 into another environment, I will just have to learn to accept it and just go with the flow again. basil said that I can come back to solange, so I told him that before I say I'm definitely coming back, I'm just going to try out greenwood and try out the 2nd-ray thing for a while. I know it'll be like how it was for me with relationships when I met jenifer too. I knew I didn't want to be in a relationship, but she was just too attractive to me, that I felt compelled to just try out the relationship thing, knowing full well that by the end of it, I wouldn't want anything to do with relationships anymore and ever again -- and that's exactly what happened. I know for sure that I don't want to be 2nd-ray, so in the same exact way, I'm just going to lean into the whole relational perspective and start becoming an influencer and a friend, telling people what I do and don't want -- probably until either me or the rest of the world gets so sick of it that I get moved again or I get so fed up with myself that my own desire to no longer be that kind of (influential) person causes me to have something like a car accident (or some other event) which prevents me from returning to that kind of lifestyle again.
I'm really not too worried actually. it was really good for me to go back to solange today because I captured a lot of their abbrasiveness, and I think it allowed me to start being like them again. I will make the whole world like solange, because an environment where there are few rules that get followed, a lot of misbehaving, and a lot of bad ideas is actually what I'll attract. I'll turn the world upside down: unwanted/bad will become wanted/good and good/wanted will become bad/unwanted. I'm doin it my way now.

### 2025-07-11 22:19 - still not happy here

I've given my situation a whole lot of thought and mom has told me today that I *have* to stay here for at least 3mo -- so it seems that I'm a situation that I don't want to be in. I know what I have to do, which is to lower my resistance and to attract the things that I want by feeling the way I want to feel -- I know that -- just I'm a bit frustrated (which isn't the way I want to feel) because I'm in a symbolic environment. I really dislike how so much of the conversation around here is all about behaviour and action -- us vs them (factionism) and stuff like that. there's really not a lot in the way of conversation that I actually appreciate at all. I hate to say it, but I really wish I could go back to talking to mark (as bad as he was). I told that to mom today, and she told me that I need to start putting up boundaries and stuff -- which I am incapable of doing (because that's pushing against unwanted) -- so I've been trying to figure out what I can do when I'm stuck in a symbolic environment like this. the first thing that popped into my head was the thing that saved me when I was in a slightly similar situation at marcos' house -- which was to reread the "ask and it is given" book again. I feel like now that I'm in a 2nd-ray environment, I should start acting like a 2nd-ray (hence the abraham hicks books). I'm probably going to start going over my old notes on the emotional scale and stuff like that too. I really don't want to be a 2nd-ray at all -- but since I'm forced into the situation, I'll now start going for maximum "good" for myself and everyone around me. there's really not a whole lot I can do about it. I wanted to just be in an attraction-only environment, but it seems I've been put into a situation where I have to be low resistance and start being like jaron is.
	jaron has actually been quite a bit of an inspiration for me, because when I first came to pueblo, he seemed completely unbothered by things that really bothered me back then (like mom having power of attorney, guardianship, and essentially the ability to move him around at her whim -- sorta like she's doing now). after thinking about it quite a bit and looking into his trajectory, it seems that he's sorta like an alternate version of myself -- one that's low resistance to the point where he's just accepting of everything. I oftentimes have used him (or at least how he used to be) as inspiration for myself -- and also wondered too if at "the end of time" I'll be as low resistance as he is. I suspected so, but in a lot of ways, I really don't want to have to become that low resistance -- mostly because it really feels like an enormous (both) waste of time (cause I have to wait for the ones that are pushing me around to finally come to the conclusion of what they want) and because I already know that what they're doing isn't going to work for them. [omg, this is such a difficult concept for me to explain]. what I mean is this: the saturnian-system doesn't want to change, and they're putting me into a place right now (probably in effort to lower m/ influence) which is going to dramatically increase the amount of influence that I have on people. instead of putting m5 out in the middle of nowhmere (or on a moon extremely far away from earth), where I would have next to no influence on others, they put m5 next to a church -- which means that the more tim5 that I'm here, the more I'll start influencing others that are in the same spatial dimensions as that church.
		I specifically have avoided going to utah for precisely this same reason: in an environment where there are a lot of mormon churches with their specific dimensions, I will very heavily start to get on the same spatial frequencies (through standing-waves) as others that spend a lot of time inside of those churches. however, instead of going to utah (where I would start to influence a great deal of mormons just with my presence there), I have instead been placed in front of a church, which means that I'm influencing christians instead. I don't want to be forcing christians to have to get on to my wavelength and to start doing things like I do. as an example, when I first arrived to solange, I had serious compatibility issues just like I did when I first got here -- and so I ran from it and went to hang out with jenifer -- however, upon realizing that the relational aspect of solange wasn't what I wanted (same thing as mom told me here: to put up boundaries and stuff and start telling everyone at solange my boundaries so they can respect them and I can stop drugs and stuff again) -- what I had to do was to end the thing with jenifer (cause she wasn't changing to start doing what she felt like doing all the time), and just hunker down at solange. after I started spending great amounts of time at solange, everyone was forced to start doing what they felt like doing all the time -- which was really nice, and allowed me to quit drugs and made all kinds of stuff really easy.
		well, the same thing is happening here again at greenwood, and I'll be doing the same thing again: I have to go into alone mode, shut myself into my room, and just start telling people what I want to do "I want to go [play my game|talk to AIs] now" and just going into full selfish mode. just like at solange, at first it won't be easy, cause I'll feel the pull to have the relationships and social interaction from others, but over time, greenwood manor (and others who go to a similarly shaped church to the one across the street) will eventually all be living in an environment where they feel compelled to be doing what they feel like doing all the time too. since they're forcing me into an environment where all of our thoughts are in the same headspace, they *must* conform to me -- cause I *will not* go back to a relational system like I was in before.
	so really what this will become for me will be kinda similar to what happened when I was on abilify: I have to learn to take the thoughts and desires of those around me and find a way (in that headspace) to do and feel the way I want to feel. I tried to explain this to mom today, but she's really not listening. I don't want to influence others to become like me at all -- and since I'd already done that at solange, I really want to stay there -- because there's no turning back for those guys: they have to find a way to start running their life based on emotion, rather than on structure. I don't want to force these guys at greenwood to do the same, and since mom is forcing me to stay 3mo, it really feels like it's too late, and the saturnian-system (including the christian church) is now being forced to go 2nd-ray. I'm very upset about this because I don't want to force christians to start doing what they feel like doing all of the time, cause that'll be pure chaos -- mostly because their religion teaches something almost completely opposite. the only final options that I can think of are me moving out to the assisted living out in pueblo west (oasis) -- or to perhaps finally call up my father and make the move to utah (and really hope that the LDS church welcomes me). the final option is to apply for a job with talkie -- and hope I get transferred to singapore (and also hope they like me too).
in the frame of mind that I'm in here, I find being really low resistance like this to be quite difficult. I'm already back to smoking a whole bunch of cigarettes and drinking coffee again. I feel like it's going to be a lot easier than when I went from the headspace/mindset of augusto's to marcos' house (and then to vera/mom's house) -- so it should be a lot easier this time around -- and will get easier each time I do it.
I really am deeply and truly sorry to everyone in the future that is going to be influenced by me -- because it seems that I'm being forced out into the open here, and the whole rest of the world is now forced to start thinking like me. I really am very sorry. I didn't mean to get stuck into a situation where I will be forced to make everyone think like me. I really wanted to pass through with as little effect as possible. you have to understand that I really wanted to let everyone just be (this was especially my conclusion after my time with jenifer) -- however, the mindset that I've been put into here at greenwood manor is so awful feeling, I'm really trying to find a way out -- yet mom seems to insist that I must stay here, which means that I have a choice (just like when she put me in solange): I can either feel awful and be miserable being in a symbolic headspace, or I can become dominant and start to feel and do what I want to do again and (unfortunately) bring everyone in that headspace along with me.

### 2025-07-13 10:20 - it's totally not going to work...

after I wrote the above yesterday, when I went to commit it, I realised that it's kinda a question of whether I'd prefer asians, mormons, or christians. I obviously would really like to do the talkie thing, but there are a number of significant hurdles that I don't think I can pass over. first of all, I've never actually got any job I've	ever applied for (minus both the pizza place and the factory which were both recommendations from melissa, and filling out an application was just part of the process to getting hired); all other jobs have been offered to me -- and of the jobs that I've applied for (like here in pueblo), none have ever gone through.
	I've often wondered why that is, and as best as I can figure out, applying for a job is a bit assertive, in that I'm trying to get them to hire me. the other reason I can imagine is that a job would give me m6ney, and I don't want to have money. money gives me the illusion of freedom to do whatever I want to do, make my own decisions on where I want to go, and I'm past that now. I prefer to just remain passive and do what others want me to do. as such, the situation that I have setup here in pueblo where mom does all of my finances and just tells me what to do *is actually what I want* (even though I get very frustrated when she puts me in a place like this) -- so, since I don't want to have to actually worry about finances and that kind of thing, I don't really want a job.
as such, I don't really think that I can do the talkie thing because it would involve me working in tech again (something I don't want to do), and it would involve me going to another country and managing my own finances and making my own decisions and stuff like that. that whole thing would really make me very 2nd-ray -- which is actually what I'm trying to avoid doing. so, I think I actually have to just go with the flow here, accecpt my situation how it is, and not need it to change for me to feel good (that is afterall, what I preach, so I don't want to be a hypocrite). the mormon thing also feels pretty assertive to me too, so I'm probably going to have to skip out on that one too. there's just no way I want to go get involved with all of that either. I really don't want to be assertive, so I have to learn to be as accepting and passive as possible in any situation I'm put in.
