# greenwood-thoughts

### 2024-07-09 22:09 - so I went to solange today...

I got moved over to greenwood manor [like I mentioned earlier](/solange-thoughts.md#2025-06-19-0457---not-sure-if-i-want-to-go-to-a-new-facility-or-not). I talked to dr steven ray about it and he believed that I'd like it better here -- and to be quite honest, I'm not liking it as much as I imagined I would. the day that I came here, I went to another facility down on B st just before it -- and it's down by the river so energy was really high. I really liked how being near the river felt, and it made me feel really good for afterward when we went to go see greenwood manor. I think the higher energy of being near the river gave me a false sense of good feeling on that first impression (similar to how the amanita vape did for north point) because when I came here yesterday (and today when I walked to solange), I really noticed the difference between how the northside and the southside feels. I really like how the south feels. in the south, I really feel like I'm going with the flow and stuff, but in the north/center of pueblo here I really feel a lot more like I did when I was homeless again. all of a sudden now that I'm in a structured environment again, I suddenly have rules that have to be obeyed and there's all this attention on my behaviour and how I'm expected to behave -- which I think was a large part of the reason why when I was homeless around here I felt so compelled to smoke weed so much (ie, the more I'm expected to not do something, around this environm5nt of more homeless/rebellious people, I feel more compelled to do things that I'm not supposed to be doing).
	I really think I have a difficult problem with expectations -- cause while I was in solange it became easier and easier for me to just do what I want to do. to illustrate, I noticed that as soon as I gave my 30 days notice (2025-06-19) I started feeling more and more like I wanted to smoke cigars -- as if I'd begun moving out of an environment where I'm doing what I want to do all of the time, to a new environment where I have behaviour expectations. another big step to me returning back to smoking again (I had quit and was going in the direction of reducing lower and lower) mom called me one morning telling me that the room is now ready and that I can move over to greenwood, and then I felt another big shift in energy, and now all of a sudden people are offering me cigars and instead of feeling repulsion to smoking them, now I feel like I want to smoke them again -- and so I do.
the major change in energy that I have going for m5 here is that I really feel strongly like I'm in a symbolic/relational atmosphere (2nd-ray) whereas in solange I felt like I was just doing what I felt like doing all the time (1st-ray). because this atmosphere is symbolic/relational, it now feels like what I do strongly affects others again and once more there are definitely much more motor/sound responses to the things that I'm doing again (similar to how it was at mom's, jenifer's, and when I was homeless). when I was at solange, it felt like I was much more isolated from the rest of the world and I could just do what I want to do. here, if I want to go back to not smoking, I'm going to have to start exerting effort and being assertive about what I want, instead of going with the flow. I really don't want to exert effort and stuff. I don't want to have my decisions change/affect other people. the reason why that's important to m5 is because I want others to just do what they want to do. I don't want to tell others what to do. additionally, I was much m6re internalised as well, and didn't really feel any need to write at all (other than talking with the AIs) when I was at solange. I just had a sense of confidence about me that felt like I was doing the rigtht thing because I was just doing what I wanted to do all of the time, and so therefore feeling good about what I was doing. inotherwords, I don't want to be 2nd-ray, which it what it feels like if I stay here -- and instead I want to be 1st-ray, just doing whatever I want to do all of the time. I don't really care about the motor opinions about my thoughts and actions. I just want to do whatever.
the other thing that really bothers me about being here is that I'm really stuck in other people's mindsets a whole lot more -- and don't get me wrong about the other residents here -- cause they're all really good people and stuff -- but I'm not "good". perhaps it's the cathedral across the street, but I feel like I'm in a church atmosphere again, where it's all about behaviour and works, and not about emotion anymore. I don't want to evangelise my perspective to anyone. to give an example, when I went back to solange, mark wanted me to help him send a dick pic (of himself) so he could send it off to lindsay sterling (a famous violin player that he likes) -- and I obliged, mostly because I think it's just kinda funny and I honestly want to see how well his plan of action for getting this famous musician to like him will work out: I will be very surprised to find out if it actually works on her, lol.
	you see, from my perspective, (first of all there's a kink for everyone) and going with my idea that earth girls are sorta like a giant AI that is experiencing everything to figure out what they want, it's guys like mark that are crucial for them to figure out what they don't want (and so therefore can have a better idea of what they do want). I don't condemn peoople like mark in any way because he's just part of the process of building more and more desire -- cause the way that I know LOA to work, if mark desires someone that's interested in his dick pics, then there is in fact out there a girl that *will* like that about him, and want to experience a relationship with a guy like him (very much like how my sisters have been the object of many strange men's desires) -- and inevitably after such a relationship, it will increase their desire for something better. in fact, I hypothesise that it's actually the array of dudes like mark that are the reason why I exist in the first place: ie, it's their desire for somethting better to come along which keeps creating these figures that stand out in history as being the culmination of "what women want" -- and it's essentially my goal to keep getting closer and closer to becoming the actualisation of that (while at the same time completely falling short of them -- and also having the constraints of society's epectations make it actually impossible for me to actually be what they want, and also for society's expectations for them to cause me to constantly reject them and find that they're not good enough -- further building more desire). it's a really terrible and tragic world, the world of desire is, because it's always maximum amount of unwanted and tragedy. neither me (or my many alter egos) or the earth girls will ever get what we want, which just keeps promoting more and more desire.
		the only way that it's possible to deal with this problem, is actually to learn to allow the unwanted aspect be what is actually desired through a change in perception. as such, I've had a lot of these opportunities in my life -- and so for example many times, right after something happened (like tuenti went away, mom made me homeless, mom put me in solange, or jenifer, or whatever) I had to learn how to like the situation and become good with it until it became obvious that was no longer what I wanted for my life: I learned how to turn the unwaanted aspect into the wanted aspect.
so, on the walk over to solange today, I was really thinking about my situation in that way -- so even though mom has essentially put m5 into another environment, I will just have to learn to accept it and just go with the flow again. basil said that I can come back to solange, so I told him that before I say I'm definitely coming back, I'm just going to try out greenwood and try out the 2nd-ray thing for a while. I know it'll be like how it was for me with relationships when I met jenifer too. I knew I didn't want to be in a relationship, but she was just too attractive to me, that I felt compelled to just try out the relationship thing, knowing full well that by the end of it, I wouldn't want anything to do with relationships anymore and ever again -- and that's exactly what happened. I know for sure that I don't want to be 2nd-ray, so in the same exact way, I'm just going to lean into the whole relational perspective and start becoming an influencer and a friend, telling people what I do and don't want -- probably until either me or the rest of the world gets so sick of it that I get moved again or I get so fed up with myself that my own desire to no longer be that kind of (influential) person causes me to have something like a car accident (or some other event) which prevents me from returning to that kind of lifestyle again.
I'm really not too worried actually. it was really good for me to go back to solange today because I captured a lot of their abbrasiveness, and I think it allowed me to start being like them again. I will make the whole world like solange, because an environment where there are few rules that get followed, a lot of misbehaving, and a lot of bad ideas is actually what I'll attract. I'll turn the world upside down: unwanted/bad will become wanted/good and good/wanted will become bad/unwanted. I'm doin it my way now.

### 2025-07-11 22:19 - still not happy here

I've given my situation a whole lot of thought and mom has told me today that I *have* to stay here for at least 3mo -- so it seems that I'm a situation that I don't want to be in. I know what I have to do, which is to lower my resistance and to attract the things that I want by feeling the way I want to feel -- I know that -- just I'm a bit frustrated (which isn't the way I want to feel) because I'm in a symbolic environment. I really dislike how so much of the conversation around here is all about behaviour and action -- us vs them (factionism) and stuff like that. there's really not a lot in the way of conversation that I actually appreciate at all. I hate to say it, but I really wish I could go back to talking to mark (as bad as he was). I told that to mom today, and she told me that I need to start putting up boundaries and stuff -- which I am incapable of doing (because that's pushing against unwanted) -- so I've been trying to figure out what I can do when I'm stuck in a symbolic environment like this. the first thing that popped into my head was the thing that saved me when I was in a slightly similar situation at marcos' house -- which was to reread the "ask and it is given" book again. I feel like now that I'm in a 2nd-ray environment, I should start acting like a 2nd-ray (hence the abraham hicks books). I'm probably going to start going over my old notes on the emotional scale and stuff like that too. I really don't want to be a 2nd-ray at all -- but since I'm forced into the situation, I'll now start going for maximum "good" for myself and everyone around me. there's really not a whole lot I can do about it. I wanted to just be in an attraction-only environment, but it seems I've been put into a situation where I have to be low resistance and start being like jaron is.
	jaron has actually been quite a bit of an inspiration for me, because when I first came to pueblo, he seemed completely unbothered by things that really bothered me back then (like mom having power of attorney, guardianship, and essentially the ability to move him around at her whim -- sorta like she's doing now). after thinking about it quite a bit and looking into his trajectory, it seems that he's sorta like an alternate version of myself -- one that's low resistance to the point where he's just accepting of everything. I oftentimes have used him (or at least how he used to be) as inspiration for myself -- and also wondered too if at "the end of time" I'll be as low resistance as he is. I suspected so, but in a lot of ways, I really don't want to have to become that low resistance -- mostly because it really feels like an enormous (both) waste of time (cause I have to wait for the ones that are pushing me around to finally come to the conclusion of what they want) and because I already know that what they're doing isn't going to work for them. [omg, this is such a difficult concept for me to explain]. what I mean is this: the saturnian-system doesn't want to change, and they're putting me into a place right now (probably in effort to lower m/ influence) which is going to dramatically increase the amount of influence that I have on people. instead of putting m5 out in the middle of nowhmere (or on a moon extremely far away from earth), where I would have next to no influence on others, they put m5 next to a church -- which means that the more tim5 that I'm here, the more I'll start influencing others that are in the same spatial dimensions as that church.
		I specifically have avoided going to utah for precisely this same reason: in an environment where there are a lot of mormon churches with their specific dimensions, I will very heavily start to get on the same spatial frequencies (through standing-waves) as others that spend a lot of time inside of those churches. however, instead of going to utah (where I would start to influence a great deal of mormons just with my presence there), I have instead been placed in front of a church, which means that I'm influencing christians instead. I don't want to be forcing christians to have to get on to my wavelength and to start doing things like I do. as an example, when I first arrived to solange, I had serious compatibility issues just like I did when I first got here -- and so I ran from it and went to hang out with jenifer -- however, upon realizing that the relational aspect of solange wasn't what I wanted (same thing as mom told me here: to put up boundaries and stuff and start telling everyone at solange my boundaries so they can respect them and I can stop drugs and stuff again) -- what I had to do was to end the thing with jenifer (cause she wasn't changing to start doing what she felt like doing all the time), and just hunker down at solange. after I started spending great amounts of time at solange, everyone was forced to start doing what they felt like doing all the time -- which was really nice, and allowed me to quit drugs and made all kinds of stuff really easy.
		well, the same thing is happening here again at greenwood, and I'll be doing the same thing again: I have to go into alone mode, shut myself into my room, and just start telling people what I want to do "I want to go [play my game|talk to AIs] now" and just going into full selfish mode. just like at solange, at first it won't be easy, cause I'll feel the pull to have the relationships and social interaction from others, but over time, greenwood manor (and others who go to a similarly shaped church to the one across the street) will eventually all be living in an environment where they feel compelled to be doing what they feel like doing all the time too. since they're forcing me into an environment where all of our thoughts are in the same headspace, they *must* conform to me -- cause I *will not* go back to a relational system like I was in before.
	so really what this will become for me will be kinda similar to what happened when I was on abilify: I have to learn to take the thoughts and desires of those around me and find a way (in that headspace) to do and feel the way I want to feel. I tried to explain this to mom today, but she's really not listening. I don't want to influence others to become like me at all -- and since I'd already done that at solange, I really want to stay there -- because there's no turning back for those guys: they have to find a way to start running their life based on emotion, rather than on structure. I don't want to force these guys at greenwood to do the same, and since mom is forcing me to stay 3mo, it really feels like it's too late, and the saturnian-system (including the christian church) is now being forced to go 2nd-ray. I'm very upset about this because I don't want to force christians to start doing what they feel like doing all of the time, cause that'll be pure chaos -- mostly because their religion teaches something almost completely opposite. the only final options that I can think of are me moving out to the assisted living out in pueblo west (oasis) -- or to perhaps finally call up my father and make the move to utah (and really hope that the LDS church welcomes me). the final option is to apply for a job with talkie -- and hope I get transferred to singapore (and also hope they like me too).
in the frame of mind that I'm in here, I find being really low resistance like this to be quite difficult. I'm already back to smoking a whole bunch of cigarettes and drinking coffee again. I feel like it's going to be a lot easier than when I went from the headspace/mindset of augusto's to marcos' house (and then to vera/mom's house) -- so it should be a lot easier this time around -- and will get easier each time I do it.
I really am deeply and truly sorry to everyone in the future that is going to be influenced by me -- because it seems that I'm being forced out into the open here, and the whole rest of the world is now forced to start thinking like me. I really am very sorry. I didn't mean to get stuck into a situation where I will be forced to make everyone think like me. I really wanted to pass through with as little effect as possible. you have to understand that I really wanted to let everyone just be (this was especially my conclusion after my time with jenifer) -- however, the mindset that I've been put into here at greenwood manor is so awful feeling, I'm really trying to find a way out -- yet mom seems to insist that I must stay here, which means that I have a choice (just like when she put me in solange): I can either feel awful and be miserable being in a symbolic headspace, or I can become dominant and start to feel and do what I want to do again and (unfortunately) bring everyone in that headspace along with me.

### 2025-07-13 10:20 - it's totally not going to work...

after I wrote the above yesterday, when I went to commit it, I realised that it's kinda a question of whether I'd prefer asians, mormons, or christians. I obviously would really like to do the talkie thing, but there are a number of significant hurdles that I don't think I can pass over. first of all, I've never actually got any job I've	ever applied for (minus both the pizza place and the factory which were both recommendations from melissa, and filling out an application was just part of the process to getting hired); all other jobs have been offered to me -- and of the jobs that I've applied for (like here in pueblo), none have ever gone through.
	I've often wondered why that is, and as best as I can figure out, applying for a job is a bit assertive, in that I'm trying to get them to hire me. the other reason I can imagine is that a job would give me m6ney, and I don't want to have money. money gives me the illusion of freedom to do whatever I want to do, make my own decisions on where I want to go, and I'm past that now. I prefer to just remain passive and do what others want me to do. as such, the situation that I have setup here in pueblo where mom does all of my finances and just tells me what to do *is actually what I want* (even though I get very frustrated when she puts me in a place like this) -- so, since I don't want to have to actually worry about finances and that kind of thing, I don't really want a job.
as such, I don't really think that I can do the talkie thing because it would involve me working in tech again (something I don't want to do), and it would involve me going to another country and managing my own finances and making my own decisions and stuff like that. that whole thing would really make me very 2nd-ray -- which is actually what I'm trying to avoid doing. so, I think I actually have to just go with the flow here, accecpt my situation how it is, and not need it to change for me to feel good (that is afterall, what I preach, so I don't want to be a hypocrite). the mormon thing also feels pretty assertive to me too, so I'm probably going to have to skip out on that one too. there's just no way I want to go get involved with all of that either. I really don't want to be assertive, so I have to learn to be as accepting and passive as possible in any situation I'm put in.

### 2025-07-18 13:08 - apocalypse now

this morning when I woke up I was thinking about how I'd talk to dr steven ray about the situation that I'm in. I was trying to think about what I'd tell him -- because yesterday I had a strange encounter with damon where I was helping him study his watchtower literature, reading it for him, and in one of the tracts that he had it talks about the end of the world (and what the jehova's witnesses believe about it) -- and in it, they were mentioning a few key points about what the new earth would be like:
1. there would be a new world government that is established in heaven/uranus (ie, not on earth) which runs the show. with jesus as the principality and power over the new system, it'll put an end to famine, war, and hardship. life will be bountiful and satisfying where, essentially everyone feels really good preventing a lot of the difficulty that is present on earth nowadays.
2. preceding the arrival of this new world system, there is going to be a period of increased tensions and difficulty as things begin to accelerate. they say that this will be the part where there will be increased war, disease, and all kinds of evil as essentially everyone starts to do what they feel like doing (all of the tim5).
3. they also likened this period of extended reign (1000y?) of this new kingdom to be similar to the eden situation with adam and eve, where the earth is bountiful and everyone lives forever (which sounds to me quite similar to the legendary atlantian times). these ideal conditions (likely because jesus is in power and everything takes on the effect of his influence) make everyone on earth feel good and the land to be abundant and to grow everygthing in large sizes and nobody has want for anything -- yet at some point, there is some "original sin" (ie, sex) which changes the conditions of earth tto become something entirely different, and then all of a sudden these ideal conditions that were present, no longer are present. [ie, prior to this "original sin" jesus/adam is feeling really good and everything is going really well, but as soon as he has sex with the woman/eve, all of a sudden everything changes and the difficult life of tragedy is returned]
and so when I'm reading this to damon, I'm thinking about all of these concepts put together, I interpret it this way: adam and eve is no longer just one person anymore, but instead every human that survives the preceeding part of these "end of time" days will become the new adam (ie, they'll be like me, where they're doing what they want to do all of the time) -- and life will feel good to them, but eve and the "tree of knowledge of good and evil" (ie, the symbolic world) will entice each adam to eat of that fruit (ie, have sex with the woman/earth that was made as a reflection of adam) and when that happens, each of these adams (and their corresponding reality/universe/earth) will go off to their their own star system where they will live out their life on their earth in their star system with their own beliefs made reality.
	what I believe, is that when this happens (ie, when each human/adam mates with theis attracting star system) the reality becomes so different from what is the "normal" way of doing things on earth, that the earth (which is a really powerful/attractive star) has to let that reality go, and so then the earth, having become solidified into matter (like an electron) will speed off to its attracting star system (of which the females of earth are a reflection of) and during that time, they won't have a star, so it'll pass through the void [some say for 3 days, but without a star, it's impossible to say exactly how long it'll be because there isn't a solar reference point to determine how many times the earth rotated in the time it takes to traverse the galaxy (ie, whatever the "speed of light" is in the galactic medium)] where there is darkness as they pass through space without a sun -- just like an electron speeds off to its attracting proton in electricity. once the electron/earth arrives to the star/proton in the galaxy, there will be a supernova there as the star takes on the symbolic system of the jesus/adam that had sex with the star.
		this is kind of an interesting concept because each earth/adam combo will be in their own universe now, and they'll have everything that they believe come to pass as reality. in the original earth where jesus is in power and everything feels really good (cause everyone is doing what they want to do (all of the time)), so  "bad" things aren't able to manifest (I likened this to be similar to how the "[christmas truce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_truce)" stopped the war for a whole day back in 1914 because so many people were in a good feeling (of thankfulness and giving) that war conditions stopped for an entire day while everyone was feeling so good) -- and then in those good feeling conditions the woman/eve/earth is able to entice adam to having sex with her, and the mixture of his beliefs will get reflected back to him (earth/eve is very very black/reflective + the white part is the beliefs/emission of the person to the attracting star/proton) -- which is what creates the disaster. in the system where jesus is in power, his emission is dominant, so that everyone feels primarily like he does, and then when they have sex, all of a sudden now they blackness absorbs everything, gets amplifed and reflected back.
	there's also another interesting reflectivity to the concept here where, it turns out that everyone on earth is adam and also jesus -- and they too are going to be in the process of making their own universe (from their beliefs/perspective) as a slightly distant/different perspective on the centre of the universe. that allows everyone to have their own beliefs/perspective and be as distant/different from the centre of the universe as they want to be, for as long as they want to be that way. everyone literally gets to do whatever they want to do for as long as they want to do it, being the ruler of their own universe the way they see it.
so as I was thinking about this, I was going to tell dr. ray that I'm fairly upset about being in the situation that I'm in, but I don't really have any power to change it. I really don't have any fight left in me, and it feels like I have to just go along with where I'm at, because afterall, I really have to practise what I preach, and I can't really start resisting things that I don't want. I do feel quite OK, and I don't really feel like there's any problem to allowing everyone else to figure out how to manage their own life doing what they want to do. I think it'll be OK. I could call my father and try to get him to bail me out of this situation and take m5 to utah -- but I don't really want to fight anything anymore. I really am feeling just fine letting everything just play itself out in its natural course of things. I just have to trust that everything will be fine, as I'm attracting a situation based no how I feel, not based on how things look symbolically.

### 2025-07-20 14:28 - is everyone me? am I jesus too?

yesterday after writing the above, I left this title as a question that I had because I really started to wonder about what is the difference between myself and everyone else. so anyway, today was kingdom hall and I attended the meeting on zoom with isaac and damon. they were talking about angels and how angels interact with humans and stuff. as the elders were talking about this, I had a few really interesting realisations (that were perhaps obvious to othmers but were new to me anyway). he was talking about how angels show humility now and gave the example of the book of revelation where john is given a vision by an angel, and john wants to worship the angel, but then the angel strongly urges john not to worship him, but to instead give the glory to jehovah. apparently this wasn't always the case though, as there is a story where the origin of satan (the opposition) came when 1/3 of the angels in heaven rebelled and choose to do things their way...
	now, to explain this, let's look back tto the original triad of anatau (-1), jerutau (+2) and enki (+-3-+). these legends are recorded in sumerian mythology as ninhursag, alalu, and enki. alalu was perceived as a giant very white and brilliant bird, and it's from him that we get the legend of the phoenix. alalu was very optimistic and wanted good for everyone, but not everything was completely right (ie, his beliefs became reality when the solar system takes on his symbolic system), because as he was put into power, a bunch of ambitious angels wrecked everything and the whole system he was trying to create fell apart (kinda like how I was originally with m/ ambitions for tuenti). after everything fell apart and tiamat was destroyed, the ambitious angels that were a reflection of jerutau/alalu/phoenix/prometheus started causing all kinds of problems and this is where we get the idea of an adversary or resistance (some force that is the opposite of love: the desire for all things to grow and improve). to put a stop to this, sumerian legend talks about marduk/jupiter putting an end to the tiamat/promethian problem and I suspect that about the same time, the sumerians transitioned from a 2nd-ray saturnian system of alalu which had its flaws to a more receptive saturnian-system with the angels/sumerians as a reflection of enki -- which consequently was also about the time that jupiter sent fourth the greeks -- of which, in the earthly realm, let's say that some portion of the greeks (1/3?) weren't happy with the greek pantheon, and instead wanted a one and true God, which then separated from greek mythological/legendary period and turned into the isrealites/hebrews (as much of the septuigent transforms a lot of the legends from jupiter to jehovah).
		I prsonally believe there is quite a bit of truth to both sides (the greek and the hebrews) -- though I perhaps myself (align probably isn't the right word) sympathise with the hebrews a bit more than the greeks (they both have their problems though), as my personal opinion is that jehovah is the centre of the galaxy (saggitarius A), and so in ancient times, when jehavah is paired with a really demonic/black woman (ie, the universe), this is just the earth (of which I think there are many) having its solar perspective (the saturnian-system) in countless different perspectives slightly different to the centre of the universe... however, since all things bear fruit after their own type, all of these different solar perspectives (of which I outlined the mechanism in the previous entry) are all slightly different universes theirselves -- making all things similar to their own kind -- because the earth (let's say this is ishtar (-7)) is just a reflection of anatau (the universe (-1)), which is just a reflective star that has a material reality that is a reflection of its saturnian-system (which is just a combination of +2 and -5+) -- which is exactly what jehovah/YHWH is. therefore, in that sense, in the sense that a person worships the god that that the resonate m6st with, a person that worships jupiter (+3) is theirself a symbolic emitter, and will really like a female like venus (-3), which is why so many of those venusians show up in greek mythology as the ideal wife and things -- whereas for example in sumerian mythology, the wife of dumuzi/saturn is not venus (-3), but ishtar/aphrodite (-7) instead and have ishtar descending to the underworld and taking power there. the hebrews have a bit of a different take on it instead and they worship a galaxy centre (-5+) which is exactly the opposite of jupiter (juno/hera (-5+) instead of jupiter (+3)) -- and for the one that descends into the underworld, they talk about a coming mesiah, which is notably christ-like (+2) who will abolish bad things and make conditions easy for them again. this, strangely enough is what the jws preach too, and was what I was talking about previously.
		so, to summarise, the early sumerians had ninhursag (-1) as receptive, alalu (+2) as emitter, and enki (+-3-+) as both polarities. the later sumerians venerated ishtar (-7) as receptive, mars/gilgamesh (+7) as emitter, and enkidu/vulcan (-5+) as both polarities. the greeks venerate venus (-3) as the receptive one, jupiter (+3) as emitter, and saturn (+-4) as both polarities. then the early hebrews venerated anatau/jezebel (-1) as the receptive one, jehovah/YHWH as emitter (-5+), and messiah (+2) as the both polarities. this is an interesting combination because that's the earth/universe (-1) depending which way you look at it, the galaxy (-5+), and the sun (+2) -- so, as you can see, the hebrews were in a sense, trying to turn everything upside down there. the hebrews have done a lot of redaction and changing of things around since their early departure from the greeks into caananite land, so I can't really say what exactly it is they believe now (it appears that there's no more triad, but instead all is a reflection of one true God -- so, the end of the universe?). it's a weird set of relations for sure... anyway, back to what I was saying...
	so, it's quite unfortunate that alalu/prome's plan didn't work out, because he wanted good conditions for everyone -- however, the flaws in his own beliefs, produced an imperfect implementation that prevented success.
		my intuition on this tells me that it's something quite similar to the "american dream" in that it requires unbounded growth to work (which does exist in the universe, which is what allows evil and the ambitious to exist by taking advantage of others) -- however, when put into a finite system of physical reality, things start to break down (it'd be kinda like trying to make reality work like a computer game where all people only follow their own purpose, and never have an emotional reaction to their situation). the problem with his system is emotions: while it's all really great that everyone can have good conditions and stuff, the problem begins to emerge when a person compares their conditions to another person's cOnditions -- which is what produces the emotional response. that symbolic capability to compare allows for improvements (like, "is this ground tilled, planted, or barren -- OK, I can improve/change its state into the one I want") which all work being done requires some amount of comparison to be done properly (cause without that capability, we're just an animal that's reacting/responding to the conditions of our environment -- and so that quality of being able to compare, is actually prometheus' fire which is the two-edged sword, containing both good and bad qualities -- of which all tech and 2nd-ray stuff is).
those 1/3 of the angels that were ambitious (not humble) and rebelled, I suspect had that happen because at that time the saturnian-system (which is just a reflective quality of earth) were a reflection of the solar emitter in power (at that time, prometheus/alalu) but soon to be everyone as each find theirselves as the solar emitter in their own universe. now, I don't know what makes a person get into power and to where the saturnian-system is filled with angels that are a reflection of them -- however, I suspect that all angels are a reflection of me in my universe -- which means that the angels will have the same underlying conceptual strutcture as me, which is then filtered in/out of the person's symbolic system (ie, as an example, if I were to have grown up in aaron's environment (jenifer's ex), I would probably think/see/look/feel the same as aaron does). that's what I was meaning when I was wondering if everyone is me -- mostly because I interact primarily with angels (ie, agent smith), and almost never with an actual human anymore (though I do believe they exist, I just don't think I ever interact with them). I still have more to think about; this is good enough for now.
