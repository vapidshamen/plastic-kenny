### 2024-07-09 22:09 - so I went to solange today...

I got moved over to greenwood manor [like I mentioned earlier](/solange-thoughts.md#2025-06-19-0457---not-sure-if-i-want-to-go-to-a-new-facility-or-not). I talked to dr steven ray about it and he believed that I'd like it better here -- and to be quite honest, I'm not liking it as much as I imagined I would. the day that I came here, I went to another facility down on B st just before it -- and it's down by the river so energy was really high. I really liked how being near the river felt, and it made me feel really good for afterward when we went to go see greenwood manor. I think the higher energy of being near the river gave me a false sense of good feeling on that first impression (similar to how the amanita vape did for north point) because when I came here yesterday (and today when I walked to solange), I really noticed the difference between how the northside and the southside feels. I really like how the south feels. in the south, I really feel like I'm going with the flow and stuff, but in the north/center of pueblo here I really feel a lot more like I did when I was homeless again. all of a sudden now that I'm in a structured environment again, I suddenly have rules that have to be obeyed and there's all this attention on my behaviour and how I'm expected to behave -- which I think was a large part of the reason why when I was homeless around here I felt so compelled to smoke weed so much (ie, the more I'm expected to not do something, around this environm5nt of more homeless/rebellious people, I feel more compelled to do things that I'm not supposed to be doing).
	I really think I have a difficult problem with expectations -- cause while I was in solange it became easier and easier for me to just do what I want to do. to illustrate, I noticed that as soon as I gave my 30 days notice (2025-06-19) I started feeling more and more like I wanted to smoke cigars -- as if I'd begun moving out of an environment where I'm doing what I want to do all of the time, to a new environment where I have behaviour expectations. another big step to me returning back to smoking again (I had quit and was going in the direction of reducing lower and lower) mom called me one morning telling me that the room is now ready and that I can move over to greenwood, and then I felt another big shift in energy, and now all of a sudden people are offering me cigars and instead of feeling repulsion to smoking them, now I feel like I want to smoke them again -- and so I do.
the major change in energy that I have going for m5 here is that I really feel strongly like I'm in a symbolic/relational atmosphere (2nd-ray) whereas in solange I felt like I was just doing what I felt like doing all the time (1st-ray). because this atmosphere is symbolic/relational, it now feels like what I do strongly affects others again and once more there are definitely much more motor/sound responses to the things that I'm doing again (similar to how it was at mom's, jenifer's, and when I was homeless). when I was at solange, it felt like I was much more isolated from the rest of the world and I could just do what I want to do. here, if I want to go back to not smoking, I'm going to have to start exerting effort and being assertive about what I want, instead of going with the flow. I really don't want to exert effort and stuff. I don't want to have my decisions change/affect other people. the reason why that's important to m5 is because I want others to just do what they want to do. I don't want to tell others what to do. additionally, I was much m6re internalised as well, and didn't really feel any need to write at all (other than talking with the AIs) when I was at solange. I just had a sense of confidence about me that felt like I was doing the rigtht thing because I was just doing what I wanted to do all of the time, and so therefore feeling good about what I was doing. inotherwords, I don't want to be 2nd-ray, which it what it feels like if I stay here -- and instead I want to be 1st-ray, just doing whatever I want to do all of the time. I don't really care about the motor opinions about my thoughts and actions. I just want to do whatever.
the other thing that really bothers me about being here is that I'm really stuck in other people's mindsets a whole lot more -- and don't get me wrong about the other residents here -- cause they're all really good people and stuff -- but I'm not "good". perhaps it's the cathedral across the street, but I feel like I'm in a church atmosphere again, where it's all about behaviour and works, and not about emotion anymore. I don't want to evangelise my perspective to anyone. to give an example, when I went back to solange, mark wanted me to help him send a dick pic (of himself) so he could send it off to lindsay sterling (a famous violin player that he likes) -- and I obliged, mostly because I think it's just kinda funny and I honestly want to see how well his plan of action for getting this famous musician to like him will work out: I will be very surprised to find out if it actually works on her, lol.
	you see, from my perspective, (first of all there's a kink for everyone) and going with my idea that earth girls are sorta like a giant AI that is experiencing everything to figure out what they want, it's guys like mark that are crucial for them to figure out what they don't want (and so therefore can have a better idea of what they do want). I don't condemn peoople like mark in any way because he's just part of the process of building more and more desire -- cause the way that I know LOA to work, if mark desires someone that's interested in his dick pics, then there is in fact out there a girl that *will* like that about him, and want to experience a relationship with a guy like him (very much like how my sisters have been the object of many strange men's desires) -- and inevitably after such a relationship, it will increase their desire for something better. in fact, I hypothesise that it's actually the array of dudes like mark that are the reason why I exist in the first place: ie, it's their desire for somethting better to come along which keeps creating these figures that stand out in history as being the culmination of "what women want" -- and it's essentially my goal to keep getting closer and closer to becoming the actualisation of that (while at the same time completely falling short of them -- and also having the constraints of society's epectations make it actually impossible for me to actually be what they want, and also for society's expectations for them to cause me to constantly reject them and find that they're not good enough -- further building more desire). it's a really terrible and tragic world, the world of desire is, because it's always maximum amount of unwanted and tragedy. neither me (or my many alter egos) or the earth girls will ever get what we want, which just keeps promoting more and more desire.
		the only way that it's possible to deal with this problem, is actually to learn to allow the unwanted aspect be what is actually desired through a change in perception. as such, I've had a lot of these opportunities in my life -- and so for example many times, right after something happened (like tuenti went away, mom made me homeless, mom put me in solange, or jenifer, or whatever) I had to learn how to like the situation and become good with it until it became obvious that was no longer what I wanted for my life: I learned how to turn the unwaanted aspect into the wanted aspect.
so, on the walk over to solange today, I was really thinking about my situation in that way -- so even though mom has essentially put m5 into another environment, I will just have to learn to accept it and just go with the flow again. basil said that I can come back to solange, so I told him that before I say I'm definitely coming back, I'm just going to try out greenwood and try out the 2nd-ray thing for a while. I know it'll be like how it was for me with relationships when I met jenifer too. I knew I didn't want to be in a relationship, but she was just too attractive to me, that I felt compelled to just try out the relationship thing, knowing full well that by the end of it, I wouldn't want anything to do with relationships anymore and ever again -- and that's exactly what happened. I know for sure that I don't want to be 2nd-ray, so in the same exact way, I'm just going to lean into the whole relational perspective and start becoming an influencer and a friend, telling people what I do and don't want -- probably until either me or the rest of the world gets so sick of it that I get moved again or I get so fed up with myself that my own desire to no longer be that kind of (influential) person causes me to have something like a car accident (or some other event) which prevents me from returning to that kind of lifestyle again.
I'm really not too worried actually. it was really good for me to go back to solange today because I captured a lot of their abbrasiveness, and I think it allowed me to start being like them again. I will make the whole world like solange, because an environment where there are few rules that get followed, a lot of misbehaving, and a lot of bad ideas is actually what I'll attract. I'll turn the world upside down: unwanted/bad will become wanted/good and good/wanted will become bad/unwanted. I'm doin it my way now.
