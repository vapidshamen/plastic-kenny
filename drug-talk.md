### 2024-09-03 09:21 - drug talk

in a few hours I have an appointment with my therapist about vraylar and drugs in general -- so I decided I wanted to write about it a bit before I go to kinda prime some of the ideas in my head and maybe there will be some inspired writing that happens as well.
a week or so ago I tried meth for the first time. I  took it very slow cause I didn't know what to expect (Hollywood portrays it as this insane time of high intensity emission) so being a bit scared of it, I only took 3Ã—~2 puffs  over the course of a few hours. we walked by the river and it was pretty chill. after the first hits I didn't notice any effect whatsoever. in fact, it only made me feel more calm and relaxed, which was quite a pleasant feeling (no pleasure or euphoria). the second and third time I didn't really experience anything significant. still having a bit of fear of it, I figured I should just quit for the day since it was such a nice experience.
then, a few days ago I tried it again for the second time. this time now that I know the drug I intended to go a bit beyond the previous one. honestly, I can't remember much of the details now because that day was the start of being awake for ~72h. sparing much of the details, it was the full junkie experience. I met a lot of new people and tried to gain as much knowledge of the experience from other people as possible -- but I consider now looking back on it, that my questions and their answers probably altered the experience of the drug significantly. this time, as I did more and more, I did finally start to experience it as a stimulant, and at its height, I started to feel agitation so I passed on a few rounds. in addition to agitation I also started to slur and have difficulty pronouncing some words, along with a lot of incomplete sentences and a general difficulty sequencing word output into correct order. I also noticed I over-explained caviats to my sentence/word choices
    I think that happens because going at a faster speed, I'm in robot/survival mode, so I'm trying to logically process things because the normal data stream is out of sync with time. to illustrate, imagine my brain runs at 1000fps -- well, to keep my slow and controlled, I only experience 30-60 fps of the 1000 -- and they're usually at regular intervals too, so I've gotten used to running at a slower speed. however, on higher doses of meth, the frames I see often have different sized gaps in them, and that makes it more difficult to process, cause like a microprocessor, I'm performing operations like decoding and branch predicting, expecting them to be done and ready for the next operation, but with irregular gaps, sometimes they come early or late -- and when the culmination of the operations is all done (ie, I understand and get their concept) my concept of what they said might need refinement or clarification as we continue to talk, my concept of what they're saying grows till I have that O-moment when I know the next question/comment I should say to continue expanding my concept of what they're saying (which is usually when I blurt out my response) and that process continues all the way up till I feel like I've reached a solution or improvement on the idea -- or someone changes the subject.
at some point, I started to get too high and the meth was actually making everything from movement (especially on my left-side) and talking, to comprehension and formulation of ideas *much more difficult*. I tried to keep myself just under that level, but sometimes I passed it again. that level is quite easy to recognise and it's also quite easy to manage, too (minus social pressures/expectations to smoke more). the weird thing about maintaining that level is that I experienced no mental fatigue whatsoever, and could have probably kept going much longer than 72h. another effect of getting too high on it, is that the higher I get, the more noise there is in my head which causes severe audio/video hallucinations.
    all hallucinations happen because the input data is unrecognisable in some way (usually cause it's too fast/much) that the brain fills in the unrecognizable bits with images/sound of what I expect/want/fear to be there in my emotional state.
I also experimented with absorbing all the smoke, because I noticed that the smoke is white, so just like a vape (which also has white smoke), the longer I hold the smoke in my lungs, the more it will absorb. I found I can take a small hit, and absorb all the smoke which makes for a longer duration high with a slower come-up -- whereas I get the intense rush feeling when the smoke is really thick and dense, which produces a low-duration high-intensity high instead. I found I preferred smaller hits, absorbing all the smoke. [ooop, gotta go]

### 2024-09-04 15:19 - vraylar and stuff

studying the effects of vraylar on me, dopamine seems to be crucial to a very large portion ofy brain function because while on it, my major difficulty was apathy, because the way I make decisions is to present myself with the concepts of the options, and the one that feels good to me (ie, the one that gives me a dopamine hit) is the one that I select; and if none feel good to me, I don't do anything. so, when my dopamine receptors are blocked, I am apathetic to doing anything cause nothing feels good to me. it was suggested to me that I make decisions logically instead based on what I need or supposed to do, but that inevitably just makes me a robot bereft of intuitive impulses -- following a script. I personally don't like that style of operation because I'm steered by logical conclusions I've come to of my "memory" of past experience. additionally my inherent naievity permits me to do and believe anything, so I'm highly succeptable to be swayed by outside opinion cause I'm not getting dopamine responses to other suggestions. I found that the only way that I can keep myself safe in a world full of schemers is to follow my intuition/dopamine -- even if logically I've been trained to do something different.
    I rely on that feedback learn and adjust in a high-speed conversation. I don't think fast enough to be able to process everything someone is saying in the moment, so that feedback is important to keep me going the way I want to go in a conversation. the other thing I noticed is that I really struggle conversationally as well because those responses indicate to me subjects that I should avoid, or during a lull, what is the next subject to approach. no new subjects inspire me and I just stand there kinda confused where to take the conversation. I guess that forces me to be more of a listener than a talker, so that's good -- but I kinda hate it because I want to talk about things that I want to talk about. most people's conversation is meaningless gibberish or acknowledgement/reinforcement of something perceived to be important. I don't really want to listen to someone, unless it's a subject I find interesting. also, dopamine helps me to grasp/feel the general concept of what someone is saying, so that I don't have to listen to all the details -- allowing me to think of a proper response for them while they're recounting the rest of the details.
mom told me today though that my dopamine responses aren't only received by me, but apparently others receive them as well -- which is really annoying for a lot of people I'm sure because my dopamine emission will be affecting the concepts in my brain but also in those around me. presently, there's nothing I can do about it and it's totally "not my problem" -- but I did want to make genetics that would solve that problem -- just saying.
I'm probably going to try vraylar again tomorrow and let the experiment run 4 days with only one pill per day instead. who knows, maybe it's possible for me to make a symbolic system of interaction based on something else (cause my brain must find a way to get that feedback again).

### 2024-09-05 14:44 - second try on vraylar

so the thing about vraylar is that it has a half-life of ~9-15 days, which means that no matter what, if I take the drug daily, I have an infinity increasing amount in my system -- though it hits an asymptote, so there is a max, but still a 1.5mg dose results in a much higher amount in the system after a month of usage. I need to write a calculator to give exact numbers, but I'd guess it approaches a maximum of about ~10x the daily dose. so, having that in mind, I decided to make a second try on it, taking only one pill per day for 4 days, so I can feel the acceleration. the first thing I noticed is that I felt more apathetic and stuff at firrst, but a few hours later I started feeling a lot better. I'm not sure if the drug has built up a dependency or not, but even the apathy and depression that I felt before from the previous attempt went away. the only variable is I drank a bit of caffeine in that time period, which I haven't had much or any of in a few weeks. I'm not quite sure what makes the drug better on continued use, but it probably has a pretty awful comedown after extended use (this experiment is only for 4d, so prolly not long enough to say concretely).
