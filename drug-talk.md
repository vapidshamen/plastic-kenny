studying the effects of vraylar on me, dopamine seems to be crucial to a very large portion ofy brain function because while on it, my major difficulty was apathy, because the way I make decisions is to present myself with the concepts of the options, and the one that feels good to me (ie, the one that gives me a dopamine hit) is the one that I select; and if none feel good to me, I don't do anything. so, when my dopamine receptors are blocked, I am apathetic to doing anything cause nothing feels good to me. it was suggested to me that I make decisions logically instead based on what I need or supposed to do, but that inevitably just makes me a robot bereft of intuitive impulses -- following a script. I personally don't like that style of operation because I'm steered by logical conclusions I've come to of my "memory" of past experience. additionally my inherent naievity permits me to do and believe anything, so I'm highly succeptable to be swayed by outside opinion cause I'm not getting dopamine responses to other suggestions. I found that the only way that I can keep myself safe in a world full of schemers is to follow my intuition/dopamine -- even if logically I've been trained to do something different.
    I rely on that feedback learn and adjust in a high-speed conversation. I don't think fast enough to be able to process everything someone is saying in the moment, so that feedback is important to keep me going the way I want to go in a conversation. the other thing I noticed is that I really struggle conversationally as well because those responses indicate to me subjects that I should avoid, or during a lull, what is the next subject to approach. no new subjects inspire me and I just stand there kinda confused where to take the conversation. I guess that forces me to be more of a listener than a talker, so that's good -- but I kinda hate it because I want to talk about things that I want to talk about. most people's conversation is meaningless gibberish or acknowledgement/reinforcement of something perceived to be important. I don't really want to listen to someone, unless it's a subject I find interesting. also, dopamine helps me to grasp/feel the general concept of what someone is saying, so that I don't have to listen to all the details -- allowing me to think of a proper response for them while they're recounting the rest of the details.
mom told me today though that my dopamine responses aren't only received by me, but apparently others receive them as well -- which is really annoying for a lot of people I'm sure because my dopamine emission will be affecting the concepts in my brain but also in those around me. presently, there's nothing I can do about it and it's totally "not my problem" -- but I did want to make genetics that would solve that problem -- just saying.
I'm probably going to try vraylar again tomorrow and let the experiment run 4 days with only one pill per day instead. who knows, maybe it's possible for me to make a symbolic system of interaction based on something else (cause my brain must find a way to get that feedback again).
