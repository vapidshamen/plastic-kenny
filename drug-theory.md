### 2024-09-11 12:24 - dopamine and the production of images

yesterday, when I was talking to my presription drug pusher (she's also pretty smart) stacy, about the function and action of dopamine, I realised that I figured out addiction's phisiologcal mechanism. I'll summarise/expand the conversation here: (all of this is my experience) dopamine is an emitter, which (afaik) a single receptor never fires all by itself. they fire in groups, and what they're doing is turning thre impulse (desire) into something motive (an image). the reason groups of them fire is that because the head is a closed/defined space, all of the differernt emissions will interfere with each other, and this will produce an astral/defined image that the brain has been trained to receive. so, for example, let's say that I want to feel good, which means that my dopamine receptors will fire, and that will (because I've trained it to) produce an image which will have the concepts of going to the fridge and looking for food, grabbing a candybar, etc. -- and I don't know if it produces a visible image for other people or not, but the intersection of those dopamine emissions will produce a concept-like structure (maybe something like a hologram) which will contain all of my solutions to wanting to feel good. obviously, that structure will largely be influenced by the vibration in my environment (people, germs, thoughts/emotions, etc), and also it'll be strongly affected by my mood, because, I think serotonin is the power source for dopamine to emit.
    the thing is, vraylar disables a lot of dopamine receptors, which means that instead of it producing a full image, I only get a partial image out of it -- which, in my case, because my concepts are directly connected to my input/output devices (mouth and body), it makes movement and talking a lot more difficult for me. so, when I don't get the full image, it strongly impairs my ability to function, because I simply can't translate my desire into a motive force (image or movement) very easily with a bunch of those receptors disabled.
another thing to consider is that this action of turning desire into an image, is the main source of tesla's visual capacity, and my ability to "look into things", so it can work for really anything that anyone wants. the only thing that the user will need to do is to learn to discern signal from noise, because dopamine emission seems to be programmed by the person but also passed down genetically trrough the parents, becuse in my process of increasing my accuracy, I would often times see/feel concepts pop up in responce to my desire which clarly were something my parents would say,-- or it's a belief that I had acquired from the church or a political organisation. each time the desire is turned into a structure, the brain filters out and interprets the resulting structure as something that *I believe* (ie the encoded neuronal structure of the brain) is the most probable/likely thing to be the best wat to turn that desire into action (ie, the most motivating).
