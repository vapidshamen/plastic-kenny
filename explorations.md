### 2024-10-11 19:20 - why is it so bad for me to be around mars

today I had an experience where there was a guy that showed up with a cart to block the direct passage of chi passing through (we experienced much wind in the lighter flame but barely any airflow) and he was spacing back and fourth which didn't name sense to me (usually they just show up and do drugs for a bit then peace out or pull out bedding) so I thought he wanted to go to meet up with the people who he came with but carried on, so I thought he wanted to go cause I can tell he (like Greg) hates how I feel. they don't like to be around me -- so I offered to not smoke so he could go away and not have to deal with how I feel, but it felt to me like he would get his stuff stollen if he were to leave, so I went to offer him that we could watch his stuff if he wants to leave -- but obviously that's the wrong thing to say cause then he really thinks that I want to take his stuff.
imagine how innocent I am and I never think to do anyone harm (unless they expect me to) so my thoughts always sound like the opposite: that I'm tryi g to take advantage of someone -- so it gets expected but I'm incapable of performing the action, the attraction\blaxk-holes attract it from someone capable of those actions.
anyway, it all seems to be about energy management -- where they don't want me to be in too speedy of particles for some reason -- and then there are some others that intentionally try to put me in high speed areas and it causes really bad things to happen (hilarious if you can identify the cosmic puns and hilarity ensuing).
