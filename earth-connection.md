### 2024-11-08 21:57 - huge realisation

a few days ago (I think it was the 6th), I my arm started to get really swollen. it appears as if it's an insect bite of some kind, but I rule that out because during the time it happened, I was walking in the snow to friendly harbor (and it would have had to bite through a big jacket and a sweater) -- or it happened once I got to friendly harbor, but that also seems unlikely to me as well because I was super sweaty from walking, and the insect would have had to have been waiting for me. I think it was a kind of injection of some kind. I've had similar spots just suddenly appear on my skin before. anyway, when I first noticed it, it felt like I had fallen on my elbow. I didn't remember falling or hitting it, so I just ignored it, thinking it would go away. around that time, there was also a huge snow storm that was supposed to hit, but all day, no matter how much it snowed, the snow wouldn't stick to the ground (it just kept melting).
	I've seen thia happen before, and I've made an association with the ground being warm and my activities. in fact, most of the winters that I've passed here I've noticed that it'll snow, but the snow won't stay on the ground too long because the ground warms up so quickly. the air is often times significantly colder than both the sun (ie, standing in direct sunlight), and the earth (ie, laying on the ground watching stars).
I was going to walk home from friendly harbor, but jen literally appeared out of nowhere and offered to take me home. I was going to tell her no because I really wanted to walk, and the snow wasn't coming down that bad. I let her take me home. at home, I had this glowing feeling from the adderall I'd taken earlier that day (20mg XR), and the snow was just awesome to look at, so I went outside and stood on mom's porch and watched the snow fall for a long while (maybe 30m or so). I was wearing a big jacket and a sweater, so I didn't really get cold, but my legs started to hurt from standing on them totally spaced out and mesmerised by the calm snow. once inside, I noticed that my arm was really starting to hurt a lot, so I had a look at it. cutting the story down a considerable amount, I also eventually showed mom and she freaked out, claiming it was a spider bite. I spent the rest of the night with a fever and potentially hypothermia, because at times my body was seemingly unable to warm up. I was also in a lot of pain. I noticed too, that even with all of the snow, the sidewalk and road *still* didn't have any snow on them. the snow still wasn't sticking. however, the next morning mom announced to me that it was finally a winter wonderland outside. I believed her, but I wasn't keen on getting up because I hurt so badly (all night long I had to get up multiple times to pee). I kept my phone on bedtime mode (no notifications), and just slept the whole day while she was doing stuff. she told me that I if I didn't feel better by 5pm, then she's going to force me to go to the doctor's office. I didn't really want to go to the doctor's office and get any antibiotics or anything like that, so I declined to go. I felt strongly that I didn't want to try and fight the poison/infection (or whatever it is), and to just absorb it and get better. I also didn't want to take my adderall either.
today, I feel a lot better, though I've slept for most the entire day. I took my adderall at 15:11 and an ibprofen, and then went to sleep for 2h or so. I don't remember all the details, but the second phase of the adderall (it's the XR one, so it's designed to release one dose gradually, and then the second dose after ~4h) started to kick in and I could feel even a little bit of the tightening of the teeth (I don't know why the second phase affected me so much). I'm obviously quite energised, that I'm up and writing and stuff, so it definitely had an effect, which wasn't only calming (like the day when I came home from friendly harbor). the only major difference is there is that the adderall calming effect seems to come (I haven't isolated the variables yet) when I'm around other people (ie, foreign vibrations), and also after I've done a lot of exercise (ie, walking more than 1-2 miles). I'm not totally sure what activates the calm and glow just quite yet.
anyway, I took a shower tonight (it had been 3 days, I think) -- but I had so much dead skin on my face that I could literally scrape it off with my fingernails. I also had tons of dead elsewhere on my body too, but not quite as much. also my facial and body hair grew very rapidly as well. as a comparison, when I was homeless, I would go 6-8 days without showering, and those times, I had far less dead skin, about the same amount of body oil, and about the same facial hair growth. inotherwords, it was as if I had passed a week's worth of time in 2 days, with *significantly* more dead skin than I'd ever had before (I was literally scraping it off of my face). dead skin implies to m5 that there's significant replacement of skin cells -- so, I postulate that my DNA is changed significantly since the infection/bite/whatever, and that my body had to get rid of a lot of cells that were no longer in frequency sync with me.
	I think that cells die when they've lost resonance to their "source" signal. so, for example, for skin cells, the cell can become damaged and lose its resonance (die) pretty easily, if the cell has been exposed to something toxic or something that it absorbs (like a virus) which dramatically changes the cell's vibration. from there, it looses connection to its energy source and dies.
		there's also this funny weird thing about how certain famous spiritual leaders are said to not have their skin decay when they die (and some can be found in a relicquary somewhere) -- well, I'm not sure what's happening there, but I imagine that the "junk" part of their DNA (ie, the conceptual part of it), is vibrating in such a way that it still maintains a significant enough of a resonance to concepts on a part of their spectrum which isn't changing (concepts change all the time, so it'd have to be a concept like love, improvement, or something basic like that), or is vibrating at a frequency which is resonant with something in the astral.
I joked with mom yesterday that I might have been injected with a new version of coronavirus, and that I was used to create the antidote, -- but seriously, if I had that much DNA changes, it's quite possible. like I told her when she wanted to take me to the doctor: I didn't want to fight the thing, but instead just absorb it, and sleep it off, cause it'll be fine.

after my shower, I was sitting on the ground thinking about all these different events, like how I've received many (more than 20, prolly more like hundreds) of injections of new devices or fluids -- or something which left a mark, and those are only the ones I know about (cause they can just remove my consciousness by putting dissonant enough vibration into my CNS (like a tremendous amount of pain will cause someone to pass out), and then once I'm gone I just come back and maybe notice that there's some time missing), not to mention the ones that could happen while I'm sleeping -- and they've been manipulating things for so long, that I've stopped trying to fight it (cause there's no way I possibly can -- and probably nobody believes me anyway), so I just absorb the whatever, and just move on.
so, my major realisation that I had was simply that all of these guys that are manipulating me, controlling the weather, and ensuring that nobody can get good conditions -- is earth.
you see, when I was born, I was very much an XX mars, where I didn't have any cOntrol over my emotions or anything like that. if I didn't have the brain haemorrhage to "save" me, I would have been like all of the rest of them. I was very smart (I could do/understand math problems in the visual aspect of my mind), so if I would have grown up just like all of the rest of the XX mars guys are like: a complete slave to their emotions -- and without being able to control their emotions, I've noticed that these guys start to get into trouble (this is why the US military exists), and either they do someone else wrong and are forced to become a vulcan [receptive male, -5+, middle] -- or, they have to pump up their emission to such a high rate, and they become a mars [emitter male, +7, top] and join in the earth system as a way to avoid attracting their own destruction (from their loss of emotional control).
	the earth is a highly attractive planet/universe, just like the X chromosome, and the earth (being a universe) resonates with *all* that is both good and bad. the earth resonantes with the "bad" stuff at a very high frequency, so when the boys are born, they too resonate with the bad at a high frequency, and so therefore they can "see" all of the badness that's all around (that was my experience anyway; I could tell when someone was lying, and could feel/sense someone's malintention). get enough exposure to that badness, and the kid starts to perceive it as normal.
	so, if there's some quantity of vibration/people/enitites out there in the universe that (for example) wants to have the good conditions, and wants to hold others away from those good conditions (something I could often times feel as a kid around others), then the earth (being a reflection of the universe), also has those vibrations -- and my experience is, the concept of acquiring good conditions for myself and keeping them away from others (or others not in my faction/group/country/friends) is a **very common vibration in the universe** -- and so there's going to be a whole lot of mars guys here that exemplify that vibration.
		the big-picture on that one is, that in many universes past, and commonly the goal of the latest universe has been to create a place with good conditions, and to enjoy those conditions through experience. however, it seems that source (or maybe I had something to do with it, who knows) has thrown a wrench into the situation, and this time around, the goal is not to get the best conditions (cause those produce good feelings/emotions), but instead to find a way to feel good, without needing the conditions to produce the feeling. sooooo, since there are all of these condition-mongerers out there in the universe, the earth has decided to use that vibration for the mars guys that run the world. they have enormous power structures that they've got setup to ensure that nobody can ever look too much to conditions, cept for the ones in the earth system.
			when I say "earth system", I'm referring to anyone that's astrally enabled -- cause once in astral, anything can be made to look like anything. the graphics are way better (it's got that extra dimension), and also there's a whole lot more visceral stuff to be felt (ie, an object can push/pull on a person emotionally), and so that world is quite nice for a lot of people, because rules can be made to determine what pushes/pulls on a person emotionally/conceptually. (inotherwords, that food can taste sooo goood, if the rules allow for the food to push good feelings/concepts, but at the same time a food can also push bad feelings, or suck the life/death out of someone too). it's a quite versatile world, that one with an extra dimension. however, the ones that are still interested in feeling good just for the sake of feeling good (ie, kids and people like myself), we're not in the earth system (ie, in plain old flat 3d). so the earth uses the ones in the earth system to micromanage all of this stuff, and ensures that they keep all of us 3d people away from using conditions to get ahead.
				though I'm not sure, the way it feels to me when I look into it, is that everyone in the earth system is directed emotionally, where a feeling will motivate them to the action that's necessary to ensure that they don't get the good conditions. so, for example, let's say that a 3d person wants to create a thing which will significantly improve their lifestyle or energy levels or something like that -- and that causes a whole bunch of other people to increase their energy levels or something, such that more people are nearby (emotionally) to the vulcans/middles in how they feel, so noticing their failure and decerase in emotion (ie, they're not feeling so superior) the mars/tops are then directed/motivated by earth (because their desire is to keep others not in their faction away from those conditions), to make changes such that the condition-mongerers remain superior. past failures increase the intensity of the (+2) motivation, and it gets sorted out.
			the thing about these guys in the earth system is that they've all invested heavily into a system where they have all of the best conditions -- and it's a symbolic one too (ie, it has hierarchy), so one can imagine that the weakest of the condition-mongerers will fall out of the system and eventually get stuck back into 3d again (where their conditions are controlled), and those who are good condition-mongerers will only get better. they'll take off toward infinity in continual improvement in their ability to control and manipulate conditions, leaving only a select few or perhaps only one as they get better and better at it -- putting more and more into 3d as time continues. obviously, and I could be the first,-- a person that finds away to feel good no matter the circumstances will also go off to infinity as well. so, it's quite likely that at some point the condition-mongerers will have to let them go to create whatever they want to create (which is probably going to be another universe).
		so, in a sense, it appears as if the whole point of all of this is to use the condition-mongerer guys to create a whole bunch of univereses.
