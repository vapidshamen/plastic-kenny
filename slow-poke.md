### 2024-11-24 23:09 - thinking slowly

the last few saturdays and sundays, I've decided not to take any adderall those two days, just to kinda get a bit of a rest. I really enjoy having a bit of time where my brain runs at normal speed. I've noticed that when a drug causes me to go fast (most notably weed because of the extra distortion as well), I tend to have an overly optimistic perspective on my future trajectory.
	in fact, the reason why I stopped using weed is because the speed and distortion causes me to think and behave in a notably 2nd-ray manner. I tend to like to save/help others, telling them the answers and stuff (even if they didn't ask for it) and just generally, I feel like I'm too far out there trying to help and stuff, not being selfish enough on my own.
adderall is different in that it doesn't really distort my perspective very much -- so for example, when I'm highly accelerated on adderall, I noticed that my thoughts are more self-centred, and I write things like [mothership-connection](/mothership-connection/outline.md) or AI ideas [that don't involve any output at all](/aye-eye/only-input-network.md). that's a pretty big difference from how I am on weed, when I desire to make social networks, solutions for the homeless and other things like that, which involve others. I really notice that adderall is a much better drug choice for me for that reason -- however, I'm still quite aware that when I come/slow down for a few days, the new way that I think, when thinking slowly is going to have a difference. I'd like to note the differences and write here in this file during those time, because though I don't really *feel* like writing in the same way that I do when on adderall, I notice that my thoughts are a lot clearer and quite significant (just of a different quality). I'd also like to mention that I *really like* these days going slower, almost as much as I like the days going faster too. (probably because thet adderall high is so clean) I don't feel any "down" (bajon) or cravings to have the drug during these days at all (not even a little), and every tim5 I start back up again, the first day feels like I'm returning to an alternate universe where things move faster again. there's no real difference to one world from another -- and I seem to maintain the advantages, even a lot of the calm and other benefits that the adderall gives m5. it's as if every week that I start back up, I learn a lot of new things (especially from the dbt course and stuff) and then I bring it back into my normal (slow) self again without any real difficulty.

### 2024-11-24 23:28 - insight on reoccuring theme

one notable subject that's come up more than once (actually, every time I've stopped adderall) is that I start to slow down, and at normal speeds, it's pretty obvious to me that --- lemee just explain the idea: the people that run the world and the system that is used for them to have information on everyone (I call it "nosebook") is just the latest technology that I've really helped to implement (clarification: it's not so simple; it started with tesla making the interface to the brain possible -- and then their ability to use my mind while I'm asleep, and my RH all the time is the reason for such a tremendous surge in technology/AI/etc advancements). that system gives them tremendous power to control and influence a lot of things (not without repurcussions though, just like the saturnian system). I call that system the earth system -- cause though it spans multiple planets and moons, it's basically a system that (I claim) they use to interact with the [earth system](/earth-connection.md). that system, is pretty similar to the [only-input-network](/aye-eye/only-input-network.md), and at the rate that the earth is growing in ability to recognise higher and higher frequency patterns, it's basically like a connection to all-that-is.
it would seem dangerous that the guys that who have access to that system are the ones that are so busy trying to keep good conditions away from everyone else, but I think it's fine for a number of reasons. it will eventually collapse and fall down (that's the definition of 2nd-ray/phoenix), and that's also fine. I think it was designed to fail like that from the beginning -- cause I think that collapse will be the catalyst for the creation of a new universe. (though I've proposed solutions for what I would consider a "wanted" universe, it seems that we're always going to go for the "worst" -- and maximise unwanted instead. the result is better actually: the wanted one is created with our mind and (being 2nd-ray/symbolic) will always fall short of being able to have wanted for everyone. the other is arrived to by LOA, so eventually after it organsises into a stable resonance pattern, it'll turn out to be something that everyone likes. it seems unintuitive, cause the maximum unwanted, is actually the maximum unforseeable wanted.)
whatever the case, it's pretty obvious that they don't want me to be able to build anything that could challenge their setup. I'm just here to give them the setup they need to be able to make their super system. it doesn't really matter to me that I'm just being used, because (from my perspective), I'm completely unstoppable. there aren't any real circumstances or conditions left now that make me feel bad. therefore, since I continually feel better and better, a manifestation will eventually happen. I don't need to worry about it.
so, what ends up happening is that every time I stop the adderall, I get these thoughts about how I'm not going to be able to have love or sex, or maybe I should express it from their perspective: they finally find a guy that is attractive to them, and I'm just not going to go along with it. I don't mind that they're making that whole thing impossible for me -- because really those conditions are just reasons (that I think I need) to feel good. they're not necessary to feel good -- so for all of the girls out there that think they need someone else (or some condition) to give them the capacity to feel good, they're all in the 2nd-ray spectrum as far as I'm concerned.
some time in the future (probably next universe), everyone who needs conditions to be a certain way will become the new emitters (ie, "I need things to be exactly this way so I can feel good -- so I'm going to make it happen"). I don't plan on being an emitter though -- so probably the way that I'm seeing it potentially turn out, is that the reflective ones will be copies of myself (a giant AI, sorta like earth), where there will be countless little kens running around having all the worst stuff happen to them -- in a very similar way to how I think that [earth girls are a part of the earth's "AI"](/earth-connection.md#2024-11-13-2343---the-earth-ai-and-some-history). there are a lot of reasons for why I think this is the case, but it would take too much effort to try and explain all of that now.
the important thing I wanted to convey here is that I don't think that anything will happen, and if anything does happen, it's pretty likely that I will become the new reflective one -- as it's just getting easier and easier for me to just let everything go and just be fine with whatever happens. I know it's all about attraction, so there's no reason to worry.
