### 2025-05-28 23:39 - trying out writing again

just to kinda see how it works, I finally decided to try writing. there are a few things on my mind because a whole lot has happened since I last wrote, mainly becuse I don't want to try and quantify my improvements in any meaningful way. instead, I'm this time I'm going to be far less oinionated, and instear just write about my problems and dwell on those (cause I have to match the vibe of the environment I'm in). [...]

I want to begin by talking about how I was announced to today that I was getting a roommate. basil had told me that I wasn't, and quite frankly I was under the impression that I'm supposed to be coasting and wasting time... I guess not, so it's back to the grind again. however, I want to relate m5 experience because I was actually really mad about this. unreasonably upset. I don't know how and why I felt so upset over getting a roommate. it really alarmed me that the emotion continued for so long too. usually, I feel a strong sense of anger about something (and the weird thing is that it all started when sophie was in the room. I've felt her emotion very strongly before, and I kinda assume the strength that I felt the emotion has something to do with her. I haven't really figured it out, and besides mom's friend queen, I've never really interacted with a black woman before in an emotional/conceptual way (cause I'm only really learning how to do it in the last 5+ years)).
	so anyway, I learned a lot from the experience so far, and I've already set myself up for another disaster tomorrow, because I really don't want to go back to the grind of having someone always around.
		I quite like laying in my room all day and just thinking. I don't have to listen to psalms or talk to someone or be aware of someone -- and that's really the big thing there, it's the being aware of someone else all the time. I ended the relationship with jenifer because I'm really enjoying my time alone (maybe it was too good -- not sure), and now I have to have a roommate again? there's already quite a lot of commotion outside, already anyway -- why do I have to be constantly bothered by stuff? I'm constantly learning to get more and more neutral to things anyway, so less and less stuff bothers me all the time -- but around here, it's quite hard to be myself.
	so then because I was thinking about writing and stuff, and this is technically my last day, I hit the psyched amanita vape, which I think is actually the source of a lot of my em6tion. so now, tonight, instead of working on improving the strong anger I was feeling, instead I wrote here instead. so, tomorrow, I really want to just decline having a roommate. I don't want to do it.
	so actually what this subject is really about, is that it's an identity thing for me. if I want to be more like myself again, I can just go to my room and stay there -- but if when I go to my room, there's always someone there, then I can't be myself anymore because my default state is now whoever is m/ roommate.
		there's actually a deeper subject here, which is that solanger is an implmementation of the saturnian-system. so is aaron's house, and I declined to be there because I was forcing them to change. if I influence the present saturnian-system to start having any kind of improvements, the system moves from 4th to 2nd ray. that means that the entirety of earth and the rest of the universe will follow, will continue to go faster and faster in their perception, until they make their return to source. I'm not going to force anyone to make their return to source, because I'm not that kind of guy, so I do not want to be at aaron's house and to interface with jenifer because I'm forcing her to be 2nd-ray, when she doesn't really want to look at the things that cause her strong negative emotion.
			essentially the difference between 4th and 2nd ray perception is that 4th takes emotions as they are, doesn't question them or really delve too far into figuring them out or explaining them. 2nd ray is actually looking to improve their perception to something more ideal and therefore is also improving their emotional state.
		so because I don't want to force her to improve, I have retreated back to solange -- because I couldn't figure out any way for me to continue to be around when she's requiring me to be dishonest around abi, and when I tell her what I really believe is happening, because it doesn't match what she believes is her truth/delusion, she disagrees and argues with me. I don't care for it. when I'm around her, I don't like feeling like I'm wrong all the time, and so like her, instead of trying to fix what's causing me discomfort, I remove myaelf from the situation. there's no way for me to be around jenifer because jenifer doesn't like to be around jenifer (I know, because I feel like her, and it's really hard to like her from her own perspective).
		around here at solange, there are also quite a few people that don't like theirself too much either, so I can just avoid them and it's no big deal. however, I do imagine that if I'm here for an extended period of time, I too (just like with jenifer) will begin to dislike solange in roughly the same way that jenifer dislikes herself.
		so what I'm saying all of this for, is to say that if I were to stay around solange for any period of time, I will start to influence saturn from 4th to 2nd. this is absolutely clear to me. whoever and whatever I am around *will* become 2nd-ray. I prefer to be as solo as possible to ensure my influence is as minimal as possible, and my hope/goal is to ensure that I make it through this timeline having minimal effect. I want it to be as if I was never here. putting me around anyone -- jenifer or a roommate will cause them to become 2nd-ray. I avoided tomas a whole bunch because I didn't want to start talking to him about stuff, so I talked with jenifer instead cause she is decidedly not going to change. I've been trying my hardest to keep my inflence as minimal as possible. I'm not doing any advertising, and the few people that I've told about my writing don't even like read it and stuff. and, even if I were having a large influence, the saturnian-system will I'm sure move this timeline to a different one where I don't even exist.
		finally, the other way I can try to say is: I really don't want to have to be around solange 24/7 with a roommate. when I live with someone or spend a lot of time around them, I will become like them, which is inevitably uncomfortable -- and so I have to find a way to feel good about how they feel, which inevitably accelerates them (just look at what happened to jenifer) and because they can't change their belief system, the crash and burn. I know they're expendables, but I just prefer to have as little influence as possible.
	so anyway, I think I've kinda decided that I'm moving out if they put me with a roommate again.
		my reasons for the decision are as follows: I don't want to leave a legacy/mark on society. I prefer not to even be known that I exist. I'm such an outrageous person as it is, I've avoided places like LA where there are lots of people that would incite me to be outrageous and to draw a big crowd. I don't want to be in the public spotlight, and if I am in the spotlight, I want to be be as boring and mundane as possible. I don't want to entertain people or influence them.
	actually, interestingly enough a long time ago when tomas was in the room, I think we smoked weed or amanita and I had this crazy vision sequence of going homeless again. over the last few weeks I keep thinking it's a good idea, but eventually reject going homeless again because then I'll be around the homeless crowd again, and they too aren't very fun to be around. I think it's actually viable to just keep my place here and just show up every day to pick up food and take a shower and stuff, but otherwise sleep outside in the field. I can even just walk over to the one in belmont where mom's apartment was and just hang out there instead cause I don't want to be around the roommate. it's kinda funny how since I liked that idea and therefore desired to be sleeping outside in the field now that it's warm again, attraction has made it so that I will now start doing that.
in closing, this event and how strong and unreasonable the emotion was about my roommate, I can't understand why it happened this way. normally, I'd just be like, "ok, I'll just go along with it and do my best to feel good and be neutral about the situation" -- and then later on when the roommate is around, I'll just get the good idea to start doing trips out to the field again. it would have been better if I just let things play out naturally. it would have been a much better feeling to get the good idea to start sleeping in the field again than to get the idea here in writing where I'm sure it could sound more like a spiteful/revengeful reaction. oops, such is the symbolic world. I just dropped in for a bit, but now that the vape is done, I probably won't buy it again, and I'll just go back to not writing. we'll see. also, I'm back to writing without music again. it's not as quiet as mom's basem5nt, but it's good enough I guess. no more nostromosis jamming.
bye for now. this was fun to talk about my problems like this. I feel like there's a bit more mystery when I write like this too.
P.S. since they're forcing me to have a rommate, I may as well just accept 2nd-ray status and go full astral/symbolic in addition to writing again and maintaining a public image (even though I hate it, I can go that way cause it'll get stripped off anyway). lol
