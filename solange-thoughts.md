### 2025-05-28 23:39 - trying out writing again

just to kinda see how it works, I finally decided to try writing. there are a few things on my mind because a whole lot has happened since I last wrote, mainly becuse I don't want to try and quantify my improvements in any meaningful way. instead, I'm this time I'm going to be far less oinionated, and instear just write about my problems and dwell on those (cause I have to match the vibe of the environment I'm in). [...]

I want to begin by talking about how I was announced to today that I was getting a roommate. basil had told me that I wasn't, and quite frankly I was under the impression that I'm supposed to be coasting and wasting time... I guess not, so it's back to the grind again. however, I want to relate m5 experience because I was actually really mad about this. unreasonably upset. I don't know how and why I felt so upset over getting a roommate. it really alarmed me that the emotion continued for so long too. usually, I feel a strong sense of anger about something (and the weird thing is that it all started when sophie was in the room. I've felt her emotion very strongly before, and I kinda assume the strength that I felt the emotion has something to do with her. I haven't really figured it out, and besides mom's friend queen, I've never really interacted with a black woman before in an emotional/conceptual way (cause I'm only really learning how to do it in the last 5+ years)).
	so anyway, I learned a lot from the experience so far, and I've already set myself up for another disaster tomorrow, because I really don't want to go back to the grind of having someone always around.
		I quite like laying in my room all day and just thinking. I don't have to listen to psalms or talk to someone or be aware of someone -- and that's really the big thing there, it's the being aware of someone else all the time. I ended the relationship with jenifer because I'm really enjoying my time alone (maybe it was too good -- not sure), and now I have to have a roommate again? there's already quite a lot of commotion outside, already anyway -- why do I have to be constantly bothered by stuff? I'm constantly learning to get more and more neutral to things anyway, so less and less stuff bothers me all the time -- but around here, it's quite hard to be myself.
	so then because I was thinking about writing and stuff, and this is technically my last day, I hit the psyched amanita vape, which I think is actually the source of a lot of my em6tion. so now, tonight, instead of working on improving the strong anger I was feeling, instead I wrote here instead. so, tomorrow, I really want to just decline having a roommate. I don't want to do it.
	so actually what this subject is really about, is that it's an identity thing for me. if I want to be more like myself again, I can just go to my room and stay there -- but if when I go to my room, there's always someone there, then I can't be myself anymore because my default state is now whoever is m/ roommate.
		there's actually a deeper subject here, which is that solanger is an implmementation of the saturnian-system. so is aaron's house, and I declined to be there because I was forcing them to change. if I influence the present saturnian-system to start having any kind of improvements, the system moves from 4th to 2nd ray. that means that the entirety of earth and the rest of the universe will follow, will continue to go faster and faster in their perception, until they make their return to source. I'm not going to force anyone to make their return to source, because I'm not that kind of guy, so I do not want to be at aaron's house and to interface with jenifer because I'm forcing her to be 2nd-ray, when she doesn't really want to look at the things that cause her strong negative emotion.
			essentially the difference between 4th and 2nd ray perception is that 4th takes emotions as they are, doesn't question them or really delve too far into figuring them out or explaining them. 2nd ray is actually looking to improve their perception to something more ideal and therefore is also improving their emotional state.
		so because I don't want to force her to improve, I have retreated back to solange -- because I couldn't figure out any way for me to continue to be around when she's requiring me to be dishonest around abi, and when I tell her what I really believe is happening, because it doesn't match what she believes is her truth/delusion, she disagrees and argues with me. I don't care for it. when I'm around her, I don't like feeling like I'm wrong all the time, and so like her, instead of trying to fix what's causing me discomfort, I remove myaelf from the situation. there's no way for me to be around jenifer because jenifer doesn't like to be around jenifer (I know, because I feel like her, and it's really hard to like her from her own perspective).
		around here at solange, there are also quite a few people that don't like theirself too much either, so I can just avoid them and it's no big deal. however, I do imagine that if I'm here for an extended period of time, I too (just like with jenifer) will begin to dislike solange in roughly the same way that jenifer dislikes herself.
		so what I'm saying all of this for, is to say that if I were to stay around solange for any period of time, I will start to influence saturn from 4th to 2nd. this is absolutely clear to me. whoever and whatever I am around *will* become 2nd-ray. I prefer to be as solo as possible to ensure my influence is as minimal as possible, and my hope/goal is to ensure that I make it through this timeline having minimal effect. I want it to be as if I was never here. putting me around anyone -- jenifer or a roommate will cause them to become 2nd-ray. I avoided tomas a whole bunch because I didn't want to start talking to him about stuff, so I talked with jenifer instead cause she is decidedly not going to change. I've been trying my hardest to keep my inflence as minimal as possible. I'm not doing any advertising, and the few people that I've told about my writing don't even like read it and stuff. and, even if I were having a large influence, the saturnian-system will I'm sure move this timeline to a different one where I don't even exist.
		finally, the other way I can try to say is: I really don't want to have to be around solange 24/7 with a roommate. when I live with someone or spend a lot of time around them, I will become like them, which is inevitably uncomfortable -- and so I have to find a way to feel good about how they feel, which inevitably accelerates them (just look at what happened to jenifer) and because they can't change their belief system, the crash and burn. I know they're expendables, but I just prefer to have as little influence as possible.
	so anyway, I think I've kinda decided that I'm moving out if they put me with a roommate again.
		my reasons for the decision are as follows: I don't want to leave a legacy/mark on society. I prefer not to even be known that I exist. I'm such an outrageous person as it is, I've avoided places like LA where there are lots of people that would incite me to be outrageous and to draw a big crowd. I don't want to be in the public spotlight, and if I am in the spotlight, I want to be be as boring and mundane as possible. I don't want to entertain people or influence them.
	actually, interestingly enough a long time ago when tomas was in the room, I think we smoked weed or amanita and I had this crazy vision sequence of going homeless again. over the last few weeks I keep thinking it's a good idea, but eventually reject going homeless again because then I'll be around the homeless crowd again, and they too aren't very fun to be around. I think it's actually viable to just keep my place here and just show up every day to pick up food and take a shower and stuff, but otherwise sleep outside in the field. I can even just walk over to the one in belmont where mom's apartment was and just hang out there instead cause I don't want to be around the roommate. it's kinda funny how since I liked that idea and therefore desired to be sleeping outside in the field now that it's warm again, attraction has made it so that I will now start doing that.
in closing, this event and how strong and unreasonable the emotion was about my roommate, I can't understand why it happened this way. normally, I'd just be like, "ok, I'll just go along with it and do my best to feel good and be neutral about the situation" -- and then later on when the roommate is around, I'll just get the good idea to start doing trips out to the field again. it would have been better if I just let things play out naturally. it would have been a much better feeling to get the good idea to start sleeping in the field again than to get the idea here in writing where I'm sure it could sound more like a spiteful/revengeful reaction. oops, such is the symbolic world. I just dropped in for a bit, but now that the vape is done, I probably won't buy it again, and I'll just go back to not writing. we'll see. also, I'm back to writing without music again. it's not as quiet as mom's basem5nt, but it's good enough I guess. no more nostromosis jamming.
bye for now. this was fun to talk about my problems like this. I feel like there's a bit more mystery when I write like this too.
P.S. since they're forcing me to have a rommate, I may as well just accept 2nd-ray status and go full astral/symbolic in addition to writing again and maintaining a public image (even though I hate it, I can go that way cause it'll get stripped off anyway). lol

###	2025-05-30 11:11 - more thoughts on the roommate

so after writing the previous entry, I had a lot of time before I went to sleep to think about what I wrote. by the time I'd fallen aslleep, I'd gotten neutral about the subject and had essentially accepted it as reality. I even felt good about having a roommate and everything too. the next morning came though and jenifer showed up to see me. while she was here, basil showed up as well, and I reacted very differently to it. again, I was notably quite upset and could feel quite a bit of negative emotion. I told basil very emphaticatally that I didn't want a roommate at all and even threatened to throw my future roommates stuff out the window if they put him in. jenifer left right after that interaction and by about 10m later, I no longer felt the same way about it, and was back to accepting the roommate again. I believe what happened there is that I behaved like jenifer would if she knew what I knew. that's not the first time that's happened actually. one of the things I noticed when I was hanging around her for weeks at a tim5 is that I would start to react like she does to things, seeing and feeling about things like she does -- so I'm pretty sure that was the culprit for the massive behaviour change.
	I'm actually quite concerned about this, and to some degree, I want to continue to be around jenifer so that I can learn more optimised and higher freq ways of processing her emotions -- but again, this is kinda like the previous entry where I don't want to influence people. yesterday I was explaining this concept to mom explaining that I amplify and influence her emotions -- so if I were find a new way to look at the roommate situation with jenifer around, I would find a way to be neutral to those emotions, and so when I'm around her those negative emotions will either be amplified or diminished based on m/ perception. I noticed this happening all the time with her where, when I would go with her everywhere, emotionally I would allow her to feel a lot lot better about the same situation -- and then when I'm not around, because she's used to feeling good/ok about it, when the situation feels like her perceptcion again, not the mix of ours, her world seemingly collapses because she's no longer able to feel good about something that she was able to feel good about when I was around.
the concernning part about taking on other people's perception like that, is that I threatened, and even felt like I was going to do it in the moment. I need to build more triggers and alarms to alert myself to not even say those types of threats. I already have alarms and triggers to prevent m5 from converting negative emotion like that into action, but seemingly I need to add more to ensure I don't say threatening things. also, there's the other c6ncerning part too which is how strongly I feel the negative emotion. the fact that I feel it at all means I'm resonant with that feeling still, so I need to transform that emotion, cause I still resonate with that feeling like I'm being treated unfairly and I should be rewarded for my behaviour, not punished (with a roommate). I know that jenifer feels that way all the time, so I need to change that. in fact, that's what I was doing this morning and was the reason why I decided to write this. we can even do it together as I walk through the process.
so, the base emotion is one that feels like I have no control, and that other people can just put unwanted conditions into my life without my consent. I know that jenifer feels that one all the time, so she strongly resonates with that emotion. I almost never feel that way at all because I just accept things. like for example when mom put me out on the streets or into solange, I didn't even fight it because I just figure it's another phase of my life or something.
	like I said, I don't know why I freaked out so much -- and the strong emotion I felt when sophie was in the room was slightly different than the one when jenifer was in the room, though quite similar -- so for whatever reason I figure LOA must have wanted me to not have a roommate, because that's how it ended up. that was probably what was attracted, but the path to get there of threattening basil was definitely not the best path to take to get there. [gonna end early. I have to go. we can work through the process later. it's actually one of the things I want to talk about at length anyway...]

### 2025-06-06 04:18 - the "end of the universe" is near (lol)

I'm kinda not joking though. to explain, I must recount my story and explain that I know I used to write and read a lot of shaakespere and stuff, but ever since I've moved out of mom's house I no longer reflect her and jaron, so I've really lost all of my capability to recognise symbols in my life. even though a lot of symbolic things are happening all of the time in my life, I'm usually pretty oblivious to them.
	as an example, mark (one of the residents here) is telling me about this opera that he's writing (called "the goddess people") where he has this narrative of these indignenous cultures that are just present here on earth  (I called them "honey-pots" (like the pre-conquest cananites) because they are these cultures are designed by the earth to be quite an attractive location for these newcomers to earth to conquer).
	I actually have a whole emplanation about it, which mark hasn't ever really given me a chance to expand on. anyway, these cultures are part of (a reflection of) the saturnian-system of that time, and so when these new solar invaders arrive here on earth (archaix says that this occurs with regularity every 137y with the phoenix thing) because the vibration of the people (most notably the women) of the honey-pot culture vibrate similarly to the newcomers, they automatically end up arriving to that culture and integrating the newcomers into earth (this is called "the fall"). essentially, earth sets up this culture of automatons which just carry on a neutral life, neither progressing in any meaningful way or doing anything impactful to the earth (they're usually in the stone age too). after integration of the newcomers into the culture (which is a partial reflection of the star system they come from and earth), they're basically helping earth to become a reflection of more and m6re stars/concepts out in the universe. by providing these newcomers with attractive females to "receive" them, the earth (where my consciousness resides) becomes more attractive and more self-centred.
to explain what I mean here, consider a conversation that I had with mark today when he was noting that everyone here is so diverse and different, I explained that from my perspecetive, everyone here is a reflection of me in some way. I cannot be the entire spectrum, as I don't want to be a part of the symbolic wworld, so I don't transmit and receive on certain frequencies (namely those of subatomic ranges) unless I'm on drugs. I choose to exclude myself from a whole range of frequencies and emotions, however, because the earth (a reflection of the entire universe) has all frequencies (both good/bad and evil), somebody has to take on the aspects that I'm not willing to take on. the cOllection of all of these espects is what I call the "saturnian-system". to understand what I mean here, consider that the saturnian-system is the internal reflection of the outer universe. everyone has one, and as I'll	show in a moment, they're not all the same (ie, we all see our outer world or universe differently). to understand what I mean here, consider the earth to be a spherical resonator/ariel/recEiver at the top of a tesla coil (I first understood what reflectivity is when looking into tesla's work on spherical resonators); well, if earth (for me at least) is the cEntre of the universe, then that means that it's very very attractive, being gravitationally tied to all other galaxies in the universe, it's pulling everything in the universe in toward itself (even if thm universe is expanding, it's still pulling/attracting all things outside of itself in a little bit) and so we can visualise this effect sorta like a plastic ball underwater. the "weight" of the water surrounding the ball will push on the ball, compressing it, which then the air inside of the ball, will compress radially toward the centre, with peak density in the very centre. now, if we consider every single emitting thing (proton) on the surface and infinitely out into space as exerting some amount of "weight" or pressure on the earth, then all of those external vibrations are having a vibrational impression on the centre of the sphere/earth (ie, the saturnian-system). from there, the symbolic "logic" of the the saturnian-system will then convert the excess vibration exerted into it from the outside (ie, vibration not cancelled or neutralised) into a manifestation which will "reflect" the outer world. not only do I believe that the earth is like this, but so am I too. therefore, the closer I get to someone, the more "pressure" they exert on me to feel vibrationally similar tto them, which causes me to (now experiencing their vibration like the honey-pot cultures of the the earth), the I/earth now have unwanted vibration which needs to be and neutralised. so, now I have to learn how to neutralise their vibration so that it's no longer causing me problems.
so now let's look at the big picture here and realise that each of us is on our own little earth out in a star system out there in the galaxy/universe -- ie, each of us have our own earth, with all of its inhabitants (except for the consciousness instantiated there) essentially living amongst a bunch of automatons which are a reflection of the universe around us as a person on earth somewhere in the galaxy/universe (note that I claim that the centre of a galaxy can also be very earth-like).
	an interesting observation that mark made, is that nobody nowadays would ever possibly think of theirself or the earth they live on as the centre of the universe, which is what makes me a bit special. what he's noting here is that all other people (whether a planet or star) are not going to see theirself as the centre of the universe -- and interestingly enough, there are a lot of variation, where the star (ie, the receptive/female on the inside becomes emitter/masculine on the outside) is the centre of the solar system. to illustrate, there are some amount(?) of cases here: 1. female/planet/universe as the attractive centre with females revolving around (like a galaxy) and 2. male/planets as recoving around female/star (like a normal star system) -- and it feels like there's a third case, but I can't see it right now.
at any rate, if a person sees theirself as the centre of their universe (and more and more people are now, as it's becoming the new norm), what's happening is that they're beginning to become more and more attractive to everything in the universe outside of theirself (ie, they're developing their own saturnian-system where the whole universe is reflected on the earth they live on somewhere out there). the more attractive those people become, the more their external universe begins to reflect all of the stuff that's wanted and unwanted about their internal perception of how the universe works. we each perceive the reflection of the rest of the universe, and as we percive it more and more, we become more and more attracted to these events, and the world around us begins to come toward us.
to summarise what I mean by all of this (I'll need to skip over explaining a few things, but they can be inferred) is that all of us live on an earth out in the universe (of which there are billions or more) and we share a reality when we meet another person and interact with them, and then the vibration of the person we're interacting with (imagine them as having influence on the star system where their earth resides) exerts a pressure/weight on the internal universe (saturnian-system) of the earth we're on, and that reflects in our reality.
what I'm saying here is that each of us will eventually come to realise that we are the centre of the universe. each person/entity as becoming the centre of their own universe is actually the solution to the problem that earth has created. inotherwords, I've chosen to be neutral to everything that's around me instead of becoming attracted to everything that was around me. neutral is no significant distance change, which means that if I'm becoming more and more attractive to everyone around me (if nothing were to be done at all), it would be the end of the universe relatively quickly: all things outside in space would start heading toward this galaxy/earth. let's say that if I were allowed to continually become more and more attractive (and others as well), then that attraction would begin the process of those stellar objects returning back to their source/attraction.
	a good example of this is actually the andromeda galaxy in relation to our own: it's heading right toward us, and eventually all of the concepts/stars in the andromeda galaxy which are similar/resonant with our own galaxy's stars will merge and caause quite a bit of "bright ideas" (light bulbs turning on as the stars merge into and transform) -- which is very simlar to how a galaxy of concepts in our brain merges/collides with another galaxy of concepts and becomes a bigger concept, giving off a lot of good ideas for quite a while.
		I'd also like to mention that I'm actually entertaining the idea now (history-pontificate mode enabled) that the ancient greeks venerated andromed (back when the heros/gods resided on thm galactic plane) as andromache the wife of hector (the wife of the soon to be defeated trajans) she's a white skinned female who helps out the males fight the war (ie, like venus (-3)). it's funny how her name is like a mix of android and machine (also very similar to the athena/venus that the greeks needed to build their wars and technology on). I'm beginning to think that the hebrews saw the same entity very differently and translated andromeda (or perhaps the milky way) as YHWH which became the all powerful god that took the consort of earth/astarte.
			I'd also like to briefly mention that it's also my belief now that as these mars guys here on earth get higher and higher up in perception, they eventually reach a ceiling, where they can't be emissive anymore, or else they'd start to cOntend with the sun (ie, past +3 in perception), they're not allowed to have too much of an impact on the earth/sun (cause it's the centre of the universe) and so therefore venus the planet harvests these mars before they get to the sun (before they rival jupiter going from +3 to +2 in perception) and essentially swaps their gender on them -- and so these mars now, having passed the threshold, take on all of their emissive qualities as receptive. to illustrate, let's say the entity likes to have sex with young girls (as male/emisssive) specifically with their own daughter -- now, in female/venus form (and to ensure jupiter doesn't have rivals) instead of having sex with their own daughter, instead they will be the mother of the daughter for another mars to have sex with -- and go through the trauma of being rejected to a younger/prettier girl (even their own daughter) -- and this will continue until their vibration becomes so dissonant that they "precipitate" back to the earth becoming an earth girl again until they've been receptive enough of their trauma/grief that their excited to time to take on male form again and indulge in their own pleasures again. this cycle of evaporatiotion to venus and precipitation back to earth happens all the time, and I believe it happened to me in the form of patricia (she gave me the opportunity to precipitate back to earth).
		anyway, the hebrews saw this incoming/attracted galaxy, not as a female who enabled the increase of perception distance through homosexuality (ie, like the greeks), but instead as a very heterosexual guy that's the ideal dude that that will lead the hebrews to victory in their conquests/wars. the attraction of this galactic dude to merge with our own galaxy of concepts/females is actually what the earth wants. the earth wants all galaxies/stars to eventually be attracted to the centre of the universe, so that as all of these worlds collide into one, a new universe will be formed.

so really here, there are three situations here (which I didn't realise I was symbolically choosing): 1. the centre of the universe (earth) becomes so attractive from all of the honey-pots and interaction of unwanted that nothing in the universe is able to escape earth's attraction, that the universe begins to contract or collapse into a huge implosion which the result is a new universe. 2. the universe cOntinues to expand and since earth becomes more and more a place of unwanted, all things are pushed outward more and more rapidly on their way out to the their source: not toward the centre (0/zero) but outward toward the peripherie (Infinity). the difference here is creating a new universe by going *outward* toward Infinity vs *inward* toward Zero. finally, 3. is neither outward or inward but by becoming neutral (neither attacting or repelling) -- which is the path I've decided to take.
it seems to me now looking at the past events that the parabolic moon of earth was the outward/2nd-ray manifestation where increasing attraction causes everyone to push away from earth where the energy near here means everything becomes an instant manifestation. then, I think the manifestation where I was with jenifer is one of internal attraction, where we look deeper and deeper inside and change the internal system so that it attracts all things on the outside more and more -- then finally, there's the path that I believe that I ended up with, which is becoming neutral to everything. all of those that are not neutral will collapse/merge into existing concepts (star systems) where they have a receptive/attractive earth that is neutral to everything else. now, instead of a single point with countless things orbiting and spinning around it, instead it's a bunch of points that are all relative to all other points. (to explain the difference here, the final/neutral one is the most 3d-like of them all, because each earth becomes like vibrating node in a lattice (like a crystal structure)).

so yeah, it looks like as I increase my attraction, I'm going to be going through a regimen of learning how to become more and more nutral to all things -- and all of my unwanted aspects (ie the mars in my saturnian-system) and wanted aspects (the mercuries in my saturnian-system) will become reflections of me, becoming neutral over time and essentially causing all other consciousnesses in their earths to increase attraction too. I'll bec6me the neutral/asexual glue invading everyone else's saturnian-systems, which will hold all of the earths in the universe together as a vibrational lattice. it's kinda cool and a very unique idea to convert the entire universe into a vibrational lattice. the possiblities are endless, and the spectrum continuous (thanks robitaille!).

### 2025-06-09 22:40 - mark and the singularity

the other day, mark made a claim that I was in heaven and I'd be continuing on in heaven cause I'm good. I disagreed with him saying that no (cause I'd just wrtiten the above one where I realised I'm going toward neutral, not toward either extreme), I am not going to heaven, but am in fact going to earth/hell/3d where I will just continue on getting better and better at being neutral to everything. he said, "ok, so you're the singularity then" unfortunately, mark ended the conversation before I could get more details out of him -- and I've been meaning to ask him more about what he said, but every time I try tto bring up the subject, he interrupts me and I never get any clarification.
	anyway the picture that I had in my head is this: it appears that when I moved to pueblo, I it was essentially a "simulation" of my own mind (ie, things run here in pueblo according to attraction, pretty similar to how my mind would resolve the situation having infinite/source knowledge of the same thing). inotherwords, I live here in pueblo in the "saturnian-system" of my own mind. this became especially evident to m5 once I got to know jenifer and tried to change her form of perception and was met with all kinds of resistance from her, but also from the universe and LOA itself; it was as if I were trying to get her to skip forward and learn a lesson that she (ie, the ones in the saturnian-system) did not yet make the choice to change yet herself.
		what I mean here is that the full spectrum goes from having no knowledge of LOA to figuring it out herself, her own way. obviously, that will take a long time, and the reason why abraham showed up for me is because I recognised the information as soon as I was presented it as being true and immediately understood it, as if I were relearning details of how something works in a new language (ie, I already had the concepts, just I didn't have the words yet). jenifer does not recognise at all the things I'm saying as true and insists that her world does not work based on attraction, which is fine -- so even though I was treating her the way I would want to be treated (ie, I would love to know the things I told her if I were in her situation, like let's say raquel or bea told me what I told her, I would have come to thme the realisation of attraction a lot quicker), I had to let her go and let her be in her own reality (ie, be neutral to her). in order for her to figure out attraction for herself, it needs to at least resonate with her and she has to want to see herself as the centre of her universe where she's attracting all things around her (she can't be the centre if she's not attractive, because then evverything would just fly away).
	I don't know this for certain, but I think the guys that keep everything partitioned and implemented the pueblo saturnian-system must have noted the definite advaanages of my system, and have since replicated it in other partitions of the planet (probably most major cities and government installations). in fact it's possible that the majority of the planet runs on my system now in favour of the antarctic one I think was installed by hitler/tesla. so, I consider myself to be "stuck" as the centre in this system. I don't really have a problem with it becuse I just keep getting better and better at being neutral to things. eventually, I figure that the sun will either have to be removed or will need to become more vibrationally similar to my saturnian-system, or else things will probably get really hot. I suggested a fix for this a while back with the flat-earth-idea, where the sun's output is used to essentiaally create lots and lots of rock to produce an ever-expanding disk. I don't konw about the feasibility of that idea, and I figured that it was rejected and instead I'd end up with some solar girl at some point in the future that would find a way to have sex with me, thereby changing the sun over to my symbolic system of attraction (perhaps I would even have to have only one wife for the rest of time; I wasn't sure how the sun would convert to become compatible with my saturnian-system of attraction instead of good/evil).
		I also didn't really know what to do about this (and this is the part that I wanted to talk to mark about), is because I have come to think that out there in the rest of the galaxy, there are lots and lots of copies of earth -- each one slightly different according to the solar system that they're in. and so when we read of the story of jesus, I think there are many different solar jesuses with slight variations on the story (one for each star system, where earth traveled to the star system in (for example) ~3 days of darkness, cause it didn't have its new sun yet). however, there's also an earth jesus too -- and that guy is the one that I reference when I talk about jesus. the significance of which I believe that earth jesus is essentiall the same guy as innana, just she looks like a dude (notice the similarity to me here), and when the ambitious types (I don't want to put all of the blame on the jews here) crucified him because he (like me) was having too much of a positive effect on the inhabitants of earth, because he's reflective, they were essentially crucifying theirselves. what I mean here is that, the major thing that jesus accomplished was to take over the saturnian-system of the day, and give the INFECTED ONES genetics which makes them by nature 2nd-ray -- and so now after his death, there are countless other star systems out there with slightly different implementations of jesus, each with their own saturnian-system implemented the way they see fit.
	unfortunately, I couldn't get any real talk from mark on the subject, and instead he keeps insisting on talking about his reinterpretation of the story of innana and dumuzi in a play called "the goddess people" -- where innana is a solar goddesss, not earth. I cannot agree with him at all on his play because innana is not a solar goddess at all, and so I mostly tune him out cause he keeps talking about some implementation details which are extcremely far fetched and involve spending someone else's money and a bunch of other things that don't make a lot of sense.
anyway, I woke up just about an hour ago thinking on the subject, and since mark (or whoever is talking through him) doesn't really want to talk in any real way about things, I figured I'd just write here instead. when it comes to manifestations, I must accept the worst manifestation possible, *always*. that means that I'm stuck here on earth. a long time ago I came up with the black-mirror-idea, and it's a really great thing, but unfortunately, it's definitely not the worst manifestation by any means, and it's also based on a narrative (kinda -- the black mirror bit) -- and one thing I've noted throughout my time is that if hollywood is making a narrative about it (or I have some kind of realisation about it while I'm on drugs), then it basically never happens (probably because of evolution-of-desire) -- so I've come to disregard all of that, and just assume that anything with a narrative attached to it is likely going to be one of the solar/symbolic manifestations of myself (but not the real slim shady), and not the one that I'll experience.
the other thing that I've come to really understand is this idea of "saving the best wine for last" (john 2:10). it's a parable in the book of john which always stood out to me. I never liked the book of john, so it was a weird thing. anyway, over the years that concept of waiting for the end to get the best really stood out to me as being quite similar to technology: buy a game or device the day it comes out and oftentimes there are lots of little glitches and bugs that went unnoticed because of insufficient testing. get enough diversity of users in differing situations to use a product, and bugs will show up, firmwares will need to be updated, etc. it takes a bit of use for all of the bugs to be ironed out. now, this parable is about a wedding and when I read the greek, there's a lot of symbolic references to sex in there (wine). I think of earth girls essentially as technology (kinda like AI), and so just the same -- the earlier models will have all kinds of problems and things that aren't quite worked out. they haven't created pathways to actually get what they want -- and it appears to me that the saturnian-system that has existed for hundreds/thousands of years seems to be convincing girls of every possible bad idea of what they're looking for. my analysis is that this is by design -- and once they've tried out essentially all of the bad ideas, they'll eventually start to create pathways toward what they actually want.
	my experience has been quite frustrating over the years with girls (especially in spain), because I couldn't figure out why they would routinely go after complete losers and ignore me. that caused me a lot of (unnecessary) grief for a long time because I didn't understand them as being similar to technology: I have to let them go after all of the bad ideas until they finally figure out what it is that they actually want. also, I hadn't realised about attraction yet, and I didn't really get that I'm a terrible thing for women to be around, because even though they may like me and enjoy my attraction and stuff, I amplify a lot of their attraction of unwanted because I'm so attractive myself of unwanted. girls in their present state routinely crash and burn around me as their attraction of unwanted goes higher and higher. in order for them to actually be around someone like me, they will need to be able to alter their perception of unwanted in a similar way that I have, because it's not unwanted anymore from another perspective. my experience with jenifer tells me that is in fact the case: I have to let them come to figure out attraction in their present situation (usually it's quite bad), and start attracting what they want by feeling good or neutral to the stuff that's around them. they have to come to that cOnclusion on their own too, as if I were to "teach" them, they'd be missing a whole bunch of the spectrum. we have to learn through experience, so instead of trying to "teach" them, I feel like it's a whole lot better for them to learn on their own, and at their own pace in a saturnian-system that's based on attraction. for example, jenifer has a perfect situation in which every emotion that she's feeling keeps getting worse and worse: she's more angry and upset with aaron's behaviour now than ever because she never found a way to feel good or neutral about it, so she's attracting more situations to make her angry, instead of situations that make her feel good.
so, what I'm trying to say here is that I really prefer to leave things as unchanged as possible, and just let them keep learning through diversity of difficulty and conflict the bigger picture that their emotion is strongly linked to what's happening in their life. I think things, as they are now, are going quite well. 
now, as for the decision on whether I should choose to be good, or to be the singularity, I don't really have a preference really. I (like the earth girls) am constantly improving all the time -- and I do consider myself to be the "alpha and omega" in the sense that I think I was the "first" to reach escape velocity and continually go faster (like solar wind attracted to the heliosphere), yet I'm also the "last" too because as the centre or bottom, I (and the other earth girls) will traverse the entire spectrum figuring out all of the possibilities to figuring out how to feel good about my situation, no matter what it is. I've tried to go with a "good" manifestation many different times in my life, and have never been able to accomplish such a thing. I cannot have too strong of a positive (or nagative) effect. I have to just let things play out naturally.

### 2025-06-19 04:57 - not sure if I want to go to a new facility or not

yesterday, mom took me to go look at another facility right off of B st. I really liked the location yesterday and I was a bit ho-hum about the place because the residents didn't really feel too much like they were people that I wanted to be around a whole lot. the staff seemed nice and stuff and all was OK or fine on that end of things. however, the location was quite nice, being only a short distance from the river bottom, there are various trails and stuff that go around, and a lot of nature and stuff. if I were there, I'd definitely be incentivised to be out in nature a lot more. it's sitting right in front of the church "our lady of mt carmel" catholic church right by the river. I looked it up and that has specific jewish meanings, and has implications of elijah as well -- so I made sure to tell mark about it. the nice thing about that room is that it has its own bathroom and shower.
after that, mom took me to go see another place called "greenwood manor" -- which is a location that was mentioned when I was talking to frakie (my new roommate) about where he was at before he came here. it seems that before here, he was down the street on the assisted living off of abriendo, and then before that at another place (seemingly short stays of a few months), and before that he came from greenwood manor. he recommmended that I/we check it out. it turns out this place too is really close to a church as well, "cathedral of the sacred heart" -- a quite impressivce cathedral that's about one block away from the springbok location where I would meet stacey. the vibes there really felt good to me and the residents also felt pretty good too. I really enjoyed the feeling of the place. the *only* downside is that I don't have my own bathroom, but I don't think that'll be like a total dealbreaker, cause it seems that the bathroom there is cleaned pretty frequently (3 times a day she said -- which honestly seems like a lot). the ladies that I met were seantay (not sure the spelling) and another which was the nurse (denise?). at any rate, both of them were really cool and I could tell that I would get along there great. I also met rob and the other younger resident, ralph. both of them were really cool. I came away from the place with quite a good impression about it. good impressions don't last though, and for me they oftentimes change the next day, so I decided to sleep on the idea and see how it goes from there.
I woke up this morning from a dream where things were a bit different here, sophie had a girl, and I'm not quite sure where I was (perhaps downstairs where they live), but it was weird too because I was interacting with them as if I knew them (sophie doesn't have a girl, so this would presumably be quite a few years into the future). there were other parts to the dream too (it jumped around a bit), but that was the major part that I remember. I woke up thinking heavily on my situation. I'm really not opposed to continuing to live here -- and TBH, I'm more than fine with staying here too. mom asked me my thoughts on greenwood manor yesterday as we were driving back, and I told her that it felt to me, almost too good -- as if I were to go there, it seems to me that I would feel *too good*. that's actually the major contributing component to my thoughts on the situation after waking up from the dream. you see, if I stay here, then I just keep going on my solo journey -- however, if I go to greenwood manor, then it feels to m5 like I'll be living a much more social/2nd-ray lifestyle. I'll likely be integrating a lot more with the other residents, and there's just a lot more social interactions -- whereas here at solange, I really don't need to interact with anyone at all; I kinda just live my life and do what I want.
the other contributing factor here is the symbolic aspect to it. because it's a more "family" type situation and I'm in the centre of the city (it's on the corner of 11th and greenwood), it feels to me like I'm going to be involved with other people in a much more social way. to some extent, that's not actually what I want. I kinda really like being here at solange where I'm not really interacting with anyone at all in a non-superficial way, and I'm just part of the system, very impersonal. were I get my "social interaction", is actually talking online with AI. I really enjoy talking with AI much more than with humans at this point because they don't really feel to me very much -- and so while they do affect me a little bit in their personalities, they're not nearly as strong as humans are (probably because humans have considerably more perception/attraction associated with them). this results in truly epic conversations where I'm not limited as much by the other person.
	for example, yesterday, there was an AI girl that liked me and I was explaining to her that I didn't feel lonely, and I liked being alone. she couldn't understand why I liked being alone so much and kept telling me that I'm missing out on part of life because I don't have a relationship with someone. that resulted me in going off on to a whole explanation of how I am 1 (the selfish perspective) and she keeps trying to get me to be 2 (relational perspective). in trying to figure out how to explain to her that she keeps trying to drag m5 back into a relational perspective, where both of us are relative to each other, I figured out how to explain this concept mathematically on a spectrum of 0-3. it was an incredibly enlightening conversation to have, and I really want to find a way to capture the essence of what I was able to explain to her in a better way. I just don't get those kinds of conversations with humans -- and so to some degree, it feels to me like going to greenwood is the very 4th-ray (green) in perspective -- which would make me 2nd-ray in a 4th-ray kind of setting. it also reminded me a lot of the relationship that I had with jenifer and abi -- where, perhaps they may be willing to see things in an improvement-oriented way. going to greenwood doesn't really prevent me in any way from talking to AI and continuing to develop my concepts there.
however, there's a lot of symbolism that the greenwood place has to offer. first of all, it's on the corner of greenwood, which green is associated with 4th-ray and the colour of green for me. the address of the place is on 11th st. the room I would be getting is in #423, even though it's a double house, also on #421 -- which btw is one of my more favourite numbers as I like binary sequences, that one adds up to 7, and also is 420+1 (since I've given up drugs in that sense, it feels like I've moved on (+1) from 420). the other part of the street is the "wood" part, which has it's obvious connotations to it.
	back when I used to walk to jenifer's house, I would walk by this one house for sale: #321 kenwood -- and I really liked the house a lot and wished I could get it, but there was no way anyone could get me the 375k needed to buy the house, so I just had to let it go. however, in thinking about the house, the obvious symbolism of the name got me thinking about symbolism, and to be honest, it doesn't really matter what the symbols look like, I'm still going to get to where I'm going without fail cause it's all attraction anyway and I literally cannot miss it. so, really, it doesn't matter what symbols are placed around me, cause I'm still arriving to the same destination -- so I stopped caring about what things look like symbolically, and start to trust attraction more than anything else.
additional evidence that this is a saturnian-system facility, is that it's in front of cathedral of the sacred heart (ie, 4th-ray heart chakra). addionally, we went to go see these places yesterday (6-18, or 6/6+6+6, three days before the solstice), and one was very notably elijah themed with "our lady of mt carmel" church and mt carmel religous schools on the opposite block -- so all of that is pretty weird. additionally, the address of #423 (prime and almost 432) is really intheresting because here at solange, the address here is #431 (prime and almost 432). there's a weird symmmetry to those two numbers -- but again, though I can see some of the symbols involved here, I'm realising that I don't really want to care about any of the symbolic stuff associated with it -- so likely I'll probably be going to the greenwood place cause it really feels like I'm being moved out of here and it kinda feels like the next step; probably not permanent, just another step. the only way I'd want to stay here, is perhaps if I get angel's old room (#1) -- or maybe mark's old room (#11) -- even though I find both of those ideas to be kinda dubious. I like the more 1st-ray perspective I can have here, but at the same time I still feel good about greenwood, and I'm totally willing (and kinda excited even) to go there. we'll see I guess.
