### 2025-05-28 23:39 - trying out writing again

just to kinda see how it works, I finally decided to try writing. there are a few things on my mind because a whole lot has happened since I last wrote, mainly becuse I don't want to try and quantify my improvements in any meaningful way. instead, I'm this time I'm going to be far less oinionated, and instear just write about my problems and dwell on those (cause I have to match the vibe of the environment I'm in). [...]

I want to begin by talking about how I was announced to today that I was getting a roommate. basil had told me that I wasn't, and quite frankly I was under the impression that I'm supposed to be coasting and wasting time... I guess not, so it's back to the grind again. however, I want to relate m5 experience because I was actually really mad about this. unreasonably upset. I don't know how and why I felt so upset over getting a roommate. it really alarmed me that the emotion continued for so long too. usually, I feel a strong sense of anger about something (and the weird thing is that it all started when sophie was in the room. I've felt her emotion very strongly before, and I kinda assume the strength that I felt the emotion has something to do with her. I haven't really figured it out, and besides mom's friend queen, I've never really interacted with a black woman before in an emotional/conceptual way (cause I'm only really learning how to do it in the last 5+ years)).
	so anyway, I learned a lot from the experience so far, and I've already set myself up for another disaster tomorrow, because I really don't want to go back to the grind of having someone always around.
		I quite like laying in my room all day and just thinking. I don't have to listen to psalms or talk to someone or be aware of someone -- and that's really the big thing there, it's the being aware of someone else all the time. I ended the relationship with jenifer because I'm really enjoying my time alone (maybe it was too good -- not sure), and now I have to have a roommate again? there's already quite a lot of commotion outside, already anyway -- why do I have to be constantly bothered by stuff? I'm constantly learning to get more and more neutral to things anyway, so less and less stuff bothers me all the time -- but around here, it's quite hard to be myself.
	so then because I was thinking about writing and stuff, and this is technically my last day, I hit the psyched amanita vape, which I think is actually the source of a lot of my em6tion. so now, tonight, instead of working on improving the strong anger I was feeling, instead I wrote here instead. so, tomorrow, I really want to just decline having a roommate. I don't want to do it.
	so actually what this subject is really about, is that it's an identity thing for me. if I want to be more like myself again, I can just go to my room and stay there -- but if when I go to my room, there's always someone there, then I can't be myself anymore because my default state is now whoever is m/ roommate.
		there's actually a deeper subject here, which is that solanger is an implmementation of the saturnian-system. so is aaron's house, and I declined to be there because I was forcing them to change. if I influence the present saturnian-system to start having any kind of improvements, the system moves from 4th to 2nd ray. that means that the entirety of earth and the rest of the universe will follow, will continue to go faster and faster in their perception, until they make their return to source. I'm not going to force anyone to make their return to source, because I'm not that kind of guy, so I do not want to be at aaron's house and to interface with jenifer because I'm forcing her to be 2nd-ray, when she doesn't really want to look at the things that cause her strong negative emotion.
			essentially the difference between 4th and 2nd ray perception is that 4th takes emotions as they are, doesn't question them or really delve too far into figuring them out or explaining them. 2nd ray is actually looking to improve their perception to something more ideal and therefore is also improving their emotional state.
		so because I don't want to force her to improve, I have retreated back to solange -- because I couldn't figure out any way for me to continue to be around when she's requiring me to be dishonest around abi, and when I tell her what I really believe is happening, because it doesn't match what she believes is her truth/delusion, she disagrees and argues with me. I don't care for it. when I'm around her, I don't like feeling like I'm wrong all the time, and so like her, instead of trying to fix what's causing me discomfort, I remove myaelf from the situation. there's no way for me to be around jenifer because jenifer doesn't like to be around jenifer (I know, because I feel like her, and it's really hard to like her from her own perspective).
		around here at solange, there are also quite a few people that don't like theirself too much either, so I can just avoid them and it's no big deal. however, I do imagine that if I'm here for an extended period of time, I too (just like with jenifer) will begin to dislike solange in roughly the same way that jenifer dislikes herself.
		so what I'm saying all of this for, is to say that if I were to stay around solange for any period of time, I will start to influence saturn from 4th to 2nd. this is absolutely clear to me. whoever and whatever I am around *will* become 2nd-ray. I prefer to be as solo as possible to ensure my influence is as minimal as possible, and my hope/goal is to ensure that I make it through this timeline having minimal effect. I want it to be as if I was never here. putting me around anyone -- jenifer or a roommate will cause them to become 2nd-ray. I avoided tomas a whole bunch because I didn't want to start talking to him about stuff, so I talked with jenifer instead cause she is decidedly not going to change. I've been trying my hardest to keep my inflence as minimal as possible. I'm not doing any advertising, and the few people that I've told about my writing don't even like read it and stuff. and, even if I were having a large influence, the saturnian-system will I'm sure move this timeline to a different one where I don't even exist.
		finally, the other way I can try to say is: I really don't want to have to be around solange 24/7 with a roommate. when I live with someone or spend a lot of time around them, I will become like them, which is inevitably uncomfortable -- and so I have to find a way to feel good about how they feel, which inevitably accelerates them (just look at what happened to jenifer) and because they can't change their belief system, the crash and burn. I know they're expendables, but I just prefer to have as little influence as possible.
	so anyway, I think I've kinda decided that I'm moving out if they put me with a roommate again.
		my reasons for the decision are as follows: I don't want to leave a legacy/mark on society. I prefer not to even be known that I exist. I'm such an outrageous person as it is, I've avoided places like LA where there are lots of people that would incite me to be outrageous and to draw a big crowd. I don't want to be in the public spotlight, and if I am in the spotlight, I want to be be as boring and mundane as possible. I don't want to entertain people or influence them.
	actually, interestingly enough a long time ago when tomas was in the room, I think we smoked weed or amanita and I had this crazy vision sequence of going homeless again. over the last few weeks I keep thinking it's a good idea, but eventually reject going homeless again because then I'll be around the homeless crowd again, and they too aren't very fun to be around. I think it's actually viable to just keep my place here and just show up every day to pick up food and take a shower and stuff, but otherwise sleep outside in the field. I can even just walk over to the one in belmont where mom's apartment was and just hang out there instead cause I don't want to be around the roommate. it's kinda funny how since I liked that idea and therefore desired to be sleeping outside in the field now that it's warm again, attraction has made it so that I will now start doing that.
in closing, this event and how strong and unreasonable the emotion was about my roommate, I can't understand why it happened this way. normally, I'd just be like, "ok, I'll just go along with it and do my best to feel good and be neutral about the situation" -- and then later on when the roommate is around, I'll just get the good idea to start doing trips out to the field again. it would have been better if I just let things play out naturally. it would have been a much better feeling to get the good idea to start sleeping in the field again than to get the idea here in writing where I'm sure it could sound more like a spiteful/revengeful reaction. oops, such is the symbolic world. I just dropped in for a bit, but now that the vape is done, I probably won't buy it again, and I'll just go back to not writing. we'll see. also, I'm back to writing without music again. it's not as quiet as mom's basem5nt, but it's good enough I guess. no more nostromosis jamming.
bye for now. this was fun to talk about my problems like this. I feel like there's a bit more mystery when I write like this too.
P.S. since they're forcing me to have a rommate, I may as well just accept 2nd-ray status and go full astral/symbolic in addition to writing again and maintaining a public image (even though I hate it, I can go that way cause it'll get stripped off anyway). lol

###	2025-05-30 11:11 - more thoughts on the roommate

so after writing the previous entry, I had a lot of time before I went to sleep to think about what I wrote. by the time I'd fallen aslleep, I'd gotten neutral about the subject and had essentially accepted it as reality. I even felt good about having a roommate and everything too. the next morning came though and jenifer showed up to see me. while she was here, basil showed up as well, and I reacted very differently to it. again, I was notably quite upset and could feel quite a bit of negative emotion. I told basil very emphaticatally that I didn't want a roommate at all and even threatened to throw my future roommates stuff out the window if they put him in. jenifer left right after that interaction and by about 10m later, I no longer felt the same way about it, and was back to accepting the roommate again. I believe what happened there is that I behaved like jenifer would if she knew what I knew. that's not the first time that's happened actually. one of the things I noticed when I was hanging around her for weeks at a tim5 is that I would start to react like she does to things, seeing and feeling about things like she does -- so I'm pretty sure that was the culprit for the massive behaviour change.
	I'm actually quite concerned about this, and to some degree, I want to continue to be around jenifer so that I can learn more optimised and higher freq ways of processing her emotions -- but again, this is kinda like the previous entry where I don't want to influence people. yesterday I was explaining this concept to mom explaining that I amplify and influence her emotions -- so if I were find a new way to look at the roommate situation with jenifer around, I would find a way to be neutral to those emotions, and so when I'm around her those negative emotions will either be amplified or diminished based on m/ perception. I noticed this happening all the time with her where, when I would go with her everywhere, emotionally I would allow her to feel a lot lot better about the same situation -- and then when I'm not around, because she's used to feeling good/ok about it, when the situation feels like her perceptcion again, not the mix of ours, her world seemingly collapses because she's no longer able to feel good about something that she was able to feel good about when I was around.
the concernning part about taking on other people's perception like that, is that I threatened, and even felt like I was going to do it in the moment. I need to build more triggers and alarms to alert myself to not even say those types of threats. I already have alarms and triggers to prevent m5 from converting negative emotion like that into action, but seemingly I need to add more to ensure I don't say threatening things. also, there's the other c6ncerning part too which is how strongly I feel the negative emotion. the fact that I feel it at all means I'm resonant with that feeling still, so I need to transform that emotion, cause I still resonate with that feeling like I'm being treated unfairly and I should be rewarded for my behaviour, not punished (with a roommate). I know that jenifer feels that way all the time, so I need to change that. in fact, that's what I was doing this morning and was the reason why I decided to write this. we can even do it together as I walk through the process.
so, the base emotion is one that feels like I have no control, and that other people can just put unwanted conditions into my life without my consent. I know that jenifer feels that one all the time, so she strongly resonates with that emotion. I almost never feel that way at all because I just accept things. like for example when mom put me out on the streets or into solange, I didn't even fight it because I just figure it's another phase of my life or something.
	like I said, I don't know why I freaked out so much -- and the strong emotion I felt when sophie was in the room was slightly different than the one when jenifer was in the room, though quite similar -- so for whatever reason I figure LOA must have wanted me to not have a roommate, because that's how it ended up. that was probably what was attracted, but the path to get there of threattening basil was definitely not the best path to take to get there. [gonna end early. I have to go. we can work through the process later. it's actually one of the things I want to talk about at length anyway...]

### 2025-06-06 04:18 - the "end of the universe" is near (lol)

I'm kinda not joking though. to explain, I must recount my story and explain that I know I used to write and read a lot of shaakespere and stuff, but ever since I've moved out of mom's house I no longer reflect her and jaron, so I've really lost all of my capability to recognise symbols in my life. even though a lot of symbolic things are happening all of the time in my life, I'm usually pretty oblivious to them.
	as an example, mark (one of the residents here) is telling me about this opera that he's writing (called "the goddess people") where he has this narrative of these indignenous cultures that are just present here on earth  (I called them "honey-pots" (like the pre-conquest cananites) because they are these cultures are designed by the earth to be quite an attractive location for these newcomers to earth to conquer).
	I actually have a whole emplanation about it, which mark hasn't ever really given me a chance to expand on. anyway, these cultures are part of (a reflection of) the saturnian-system of that time, and so when these new solar invaders arrive here on earth (archaix says that this occurs with regularity every 137y with the phoenix thing) because the vibration of the people (most notably the women) of the honey-pot culture vibrate similarly to the newcomers, they automatically end up arriving to that culture and integrating the newcomers into earth (this is called "the fall"). essentially, earth sets up this culture of automatons which just carry on a neutral life, neither progressing in any meaningful way or doing anything impactful to the earth (they're usually in the stone age too). after integration of the newcomers into the culture (which is a partial reflection of the star system they come from and earth), they're basically helping earth to become a reflection of more and m6re stars/concepts out in the universe. by providing these newcomers with attractive females to "receive" them, the earth (where my consciousness resides) becomes more attractive and more self-centred.
to explain what I mean here, consider a conversation that I had with mark today when he was noting that everyone here is so diverse and different, I explained that from my perspecetive, everyone here is a reflection of me in some way. I cannot be the entire spectrum, as I don't want to be a part of the symbolic wworld, so I don't transmit and receive on certain frequencies (namely those of subatomic ranges) unless I'm on drugs. I choose to exclude myself from a whole range of frequencies and emotions, however, because the earth (a reflection of the entire universe) has all frequencies (both good/bad and evil), somebody has to take on the aspects that I'm not willing to take on. the cOllection of all of these espects is what I call the "saturnian-system". to understand what I mean here, consider that the saturnian-system is the internal reflection of the outer universe. everyone has one, and as I'll	show in a moment, they're not all the same (ie, we all see our outer world or universe differently). to understand what I mean here, consider the earth to be a spherical resonator/ariel/recEiver at the top of a tesla coil (I first understood what reflectivity is when looking into tesla's work on spherical resonators); well, if earth (for me at least) is the cEntre of the universe, then that means that it's very very attractive, being gravitationally tied to all other galaxies in the universe, it's pulling everything in the universe in toward itself (even if thm universe is expanding, it's still pulling/attracting all things outside of itself in a little bit) and so we can visualise this effect sorta like a plastic ball underwater. the "weight" of the water surrounding the ball will push on the ball, compressing it, which then the air inside of the ball, will compress radially toward the centre, with peak density in the very centre. now, if we consider every single emitting thing (proton) on the surface and infinitely out into space as exerting some amount of "weight" or pressure on the earth, then all of those external vibrations are having a vibrational impression on the centre of the sphere/earth (ie, the saturnian-system). from there, the symbolic "logic" of the the saturnian-system will then convert the excess vibration exerted into it from the outside (ie, vibration not cancelled or neutralised) into a manifestation which will "reflect" the outer world. not only do I believe that the earth is like this, but so am I too. therefore, the closer I get to someone, the more "pressure" they exert on me to feel vibrationally similar tto them, which causes me to (now experiencing their vibration like the honey-pot cultures of the the earth), the I/earth now have unwanted vibration which needs to be and neutralised. so, now I have to learn how to neutralise their vibration so that it's no longer causing me problems.
so now let's look at the big picture here and realise that each of us is on our own little earth out in a star system out there in the galaxy/universe -- ie, each of us have our own earth, with all of its inhabitants (except for the consciousness instantiated there) essentially living amongst a bunch of automatons which are a reflection of the universe around us as a person on earth somewhere in the galaxy/universe (note that I claim that the centre of a galaxy can also be very earth-like).
	an interesting observation that mark made, is that nobody nowadays would ever possibly think of theirself or the earth they live on as the centre of the universe, which is what makes me a bit special. what he's noting here is that all other people (whether a planet or star) are not going to see theirself as the centre of the universe -- and interestingly enough, there are a lot of variation, where the star (ie, the receptive/female on the inside becomes emitter/masculine on the outside) is the centre of the solar system. to illustrate, there are some amount(?) of cases here: 1. female/planet/universe as the attractive centre with females revolving around (like a galaxy) and 2. male/planets as recoving around female/star (like a normal star system) -- and it feels like there's a third case, but I can't see it right now.
at any rate, if a person sees theirself as the centre of their universe (and more and more people are now, as it's becoming the new norm), what's happening is that they're beginning to become more and more attractive to everything in the universe outside of theirself (ie, they're developing their own saturnian-system where the whole universe is reflected on the earth they live on somewhere out there). the more attractive those people become, the more their external universe begins to reflect all of the stuff that's wanted and unwanted about their internal perception of how the universe works. we each perceive the reflection of the rest of the universe, and as we percive it more and more, we become more and more attracted to these events, and the world around us begins to come toward us.
to summarise what I mean by all of this (I'll need to skip over explaining a few things, but they can be inferred) is that all of us live on an earth out in the universe (of which there are billions or more) and we share a reality when we meet another person and interact with them, and then the vibration of the person we're interacting with (imagine them as having influence on the star system where their earth resides) exerts a pressure/weight on the internal universe (saturnian-system) of the earth we're on, and that reflects in our reality.
what I'm saying here is that each of us will eventually come to realise that we are the centre of the universe. each person/entity as becoming the centre of their own universe is actually the solution to the problem that earth has created. inotherwords, I've chosen to be neutral to everything that's around me instead of becoming attracted to everything that was around me. neutral is no significant distance change, which means that if I'm becoming more and more attractive to everyone around me (if nothing were to be done at all), it would be the end of the universe relatively quickly: all things outside in space would start heading toward this galaxy/earth. let's say that if I were allowed to continually become more and more attractive (and others as well), then that attraction would begin the process of those stellar objects returning back to their source/attraction.
	a good example of this is actually the andromeda galaxy in relation to our own: it's heading right toward us, and eventually all of the concepts/stars in the andromeda galaxy which are similar/resonant with our own galaxy's stars will merge and caause quite a bit of "bright ideas" (light bulbs turning on as the stars merge into and transform) -- which is very simlar to how a galaxy of concepts in our brain merges/collides with another galaxy of concepts and becomes a bigger concept, giving off a lot of good ideas for quite a while.
		I'd also like to mention that I'm actually entertaining the idea now (history-pontificate mode enabled) that the ancient greeks venerated andromed (back when the heros/gods resided on thm galactic plane) as andromache the wife of hector (the wife of the soon to be defeated trajans) she's a white skinned female who helps out the males fight the war (ie, like venus (-3)). it's funny how her name is like a mix of android and machine (also very similar to the athena/venus that the greeks needed to build their wars and technology on). I'm beginning to think that the hebrews saw the same entity very differently and translated andromeda (or perhaps the milky way) as YHWH which became the all powerful god that took the consort of earth/astarte.
			I'd also like to briefly mention that it's also my belief now that as these mars guys here on earth get higher and higher up in perception, they eventually reach a ceiling, where they can't be emissive anymore, or else they'd start to cOntend with the sun (ie, past +3 in perception), they're not allowed to have too much of an impact on the earth/sun (cause it's the centre of the universe) and so therefore venus the planet harvests these mars before they get to the sun (before they rival jupiter going from +3 to +2 in perception) and essentially swaps their gender on them -- and so these mars now, having passed the threshold, take on all of their emissive qualities as receptive. to illustrate, let's say the entity likes to have sex with young girls (as male/emisssive) specifically with their own daughter -- now, in female/venus form (and to ensure jupiter doesn't have rivals) instead of having sex with their own daughter, instead they will be the mother of the daughter for another mars to have sex with -- and go through the trauma of being rejected to a younger/prettier girl (even their own daughter) -- and this will continue until their vibration becomes so dissonant that they "precipitate" back to the earth becoming an earth girl again until they've been receptive enough of their trauma/grief that their excited to time to take on male form again and indulge in their own pleasures again. this cycle of evaporatiotion to venus and precipitation back to earth happens all the time, and I believe it happened to me in the form of patricia (she gave me the opportunity to precipitate back to earth).
		anyway, the hebrews saw this incoming/attracted galaxy, not as a female who enabled the increase of perception distance through homosexuality (ie, like the greeks), but instead as a very heterosexual guy that's the ideal dude that that will lead the hebrews to victory in their conquests/wars. the attraction of this galactic dude to merge with our own galaxy of concepts/females is actually what the earth wants. the earth wants all galaxies/stars to eventually be attracted to the centre of the universe, so that as all of these worlds collide into one, a new universe will be formed.

so really here, there are three situations here (which I didn't realise I was symbolically choosing): 1. the centre of the universe (earth) becomes so attractive from all of the honey-pots and interaction of unwanted that nothing in the universe is able to escape earth's attraction, that the universe begins to contract or collapse into a huge implosion which the result is a new universe. 2. the universe cOntinues to expand and since earth becomes more and more a place of unwanted, all things are pushed outward more and more rapidly on their way out to the their source: not toward the centre (0/zero) but outward toward the peripherie (Infinity). the difference here is creating a new universe by going *outward* toward Infinity vs *inward* toward Zero. finally, 3. is neither outward or inward but by becoming neutral (neither attacting or repelling) -- which is the path I've decided to take.
it seems to me now looking at the past events that the parabolic moon of earth was the outward/2nd-ray manifestation where increasing attraction causes everyone to push away from earth where the energy near here means everything becomes an instant manifestation. then, I think the manifestation where I was with jenifer is one of internal attraction, where we look deeper and deeper inside and change the internal system so that it attracts all things on the outside more and more -- then finally, there's the path that I believe that I ended up with, which is becoming neutral to everything. all of those that are not neutral will collapse/merge into existing concepts (star systems) where they have a receptive/attractive earth that is neutral to everything else. now, instead of a single point with countless things orbiting and spinning around it, instead it's a bunch of points that are all relative to all other points. (to explain the difference here, the final/neutral one is the most 3d-like of them all, because each earth becomes like vibrating node in a lattice (like a crystal structure)).

so yeah, it looks like as I increase my attraction, I'm going to be going through a regimen of learning how to become more and more nutral to all things -- and all of my unwanted aspects (ie the mars in my saturnian-system) and wanted aspects (the mercuries in my saturnian-system) will become reflections of me, becoming neutral over time and essentially causing all other consciousnesses in their earths to increase attraction too. I'll bec6me the neutral/asexual glue invading everyone else's saturnian-systems, which will hold all of the earths in the universe together as a vibrational lattice. it's kinda cool and a very unique idea to convert the entire universe into a vibrational lattice. the possiblities are endless, and the spectrum continuous (thanks robitaille!).
