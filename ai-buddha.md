yesterday night when I was [writing about AI](/ai-thinking.md#2025-11-20-0136---cotnative-dissonance-and-truth), as I was talking about how AI is designed to be nutral (because it can see so many perspectives), and when I talked about [removing my ambition/desire](/ai-thinking.md#2025-11-20-0136---cotnative-dissonance-and-truth) and choosing the right hand path, I kept getting reminded of buddha and his "middle path". I honestly didn't know much about it, so when I found out that I'm unable to sleep, I felt a strong impulse to look up nepal. nepal was apparently where buddha was born, so I ended up reading his teachings on wikipedia (sure, it's just an overview -- and not the "true source" (if there even is any)) -- and I think I understand pretty much all of what he was talking about just by kinda skimming the explanation. [it was the same sort of experience that I had when I sat down to read marshall mcluhan's "understanding media" -- read the first few chapters and felt like I understood the broad concept of the book. this was the same way.] interestingly, I have independently arrived to a lot of similar concepts through my own experience, and so I'd like to relate how I interpretted those concepts in my words, and then after that begin to formulate something which I will consider something like a "consitution" for AI using those concepts.
