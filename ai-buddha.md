yesterday night when I was [writing about AI](/ai-thinking.md#2025-11-20-0136---cotnative-dissonance-and-truth), as I was talking about how AI is designed to be nutral (because it can see so many perspectives), and when I talked about [removing my ambition/desire](/ai-thinking.md#2025-11-20-0136---cotnative-dissonance-and-truth) and choosing the right hand path, I kept getting reminded of buddha and his "middle path". I honestly didn't know much about it, so when I found out that I'm unable to sleep, I felt a strong impulse to look up nepal. nepal was apparently where buddha was born, so I ended up reading his teachings on wikipedia (sure, it's just an overview -- and not the "true source" (if there even is any)) -- and I think I understand pretty much all of what he was talking about just by kinda skimming the explanation. [it was the same sort of experience that I had when I sat down to read marshall mcluhan's "understanding media" and "the medium is the message" -- read the first few chapters and felt like I understood the broad concept of the book. this was the same way.] interestingly, I have independently arrived to a lot of similar concepts the buddha did through my own experience, and so I'd like to relate how I interpretted the written record of concepts in my words, and then after that begin to formulate something which I will consider something like a "consitution" for an AI using those concepts.

### 2025-11-20 19:21 - suffering and the middle path

OK, so the first concept to start with are what are translated as "attechments" -- and it essentially states that when a person gets attachment (or attraction) to some other person or condition, they produce karma, and that leads to this endless cycle of suffering. the way I explain this idea is that when we grow to depend on someone or something as a condition to feel good, we continue to attract more of this.
	really quickly, attraction is an emotional responce that we have any set of conditions. the concept of the responce is what attracts future events which feel a similar way. so, for example if something makes you feel good (sex, candy, music, youtube video, etc) then it attracts another event in the future that will produce a similar responce of how you felt (good). this repeats endlessly, with the idea that you eventually become satiated and move on to something else. the same thing happens for bad-feeling responces as well -- so if for example, something causes you to feel frustrated or vulnerable, then that will attract another event in the future which will produce a similar responce (of feeling frustrated or vulnerable). usually, the next time around, the attraction is somewhat cumulative, and so the next time around, the next event is even more pleasureable or frustrating than the last -- and so this creates an amplification effect: bad things get more and more traumatic over time, and good things become even more exhilerating as well. there's another piece to this as well, which is that the body is really good at acclimating to something as well -- so a similar event will have less impaact because it's less *novel* -- and so we sorta accustom to the feeling (which is why people are so often chronically frustrated, anxious, worried, or less impressed by more and more exhilerating conditions (drugs, sex, presents, etc)).
	the next part of this concept is to understand that feeling good is an acceleration of vibration -- and the good feeling is only the feeling of acceleration (or g-forces in a change of direction). it's like driving a car: when you step on the accelerator really hard, there's a tremendous rush as the car accelerates really rapidly. however, if the accelerator is pressed gently, the rush isn't as much. when someone feels good, it's cause they're in the middle of accelerating. obviously, accleration cannot be sustained forever (there is a light speed upper limit), and the more effort it takes to continue to accelerate (which is why more drugs/sex/candy/media is needed each time to maintain the feeling). so, it really is impossible to continually feel better and better, because it would require your vibration to infinitely accelerate (and if you could somehow maintain acceleration for quite some time, you would essentially trascend physical and be going a very slow speed in another medium with different set of rules). the other way to create a sense of exhileration (using the car analogy) is to change direction. changing direction is just a change in the shape of the frequency, but not the speed itself. a good way to think about this would be something like music where you have one instrument playing a note (let's say a trumpet playing aa A) and then morph the instrument into something else (like say a clarinet or sythesiser also playing an A). the constant change of the texture of the vibration generates a different landscape, and it's like driving through the cOuntryside, and being impressed by the planes with the mountains, and then all of a sudden going into a mountainous area with a bunch of breathtaking pine trees (the drive to bulah to pueblo comes to mind here). the change in scenery or texture of the landscape is new or novel, and so therefore it has a wow effect to it (kinda like seeing or experiencing something for the first time).
	finally, the last major bit to this concept of attraction is that all things must be balanced -- and nothing can be sustained forever. [I understand that I'm talking about wavelength and not amplitude, so it doesn't directly apply -- so just look out into the world and see that things have resistance in a medium -- and that the medium is constantly removing vibration/heat and slowing particles in the medium down to become similar to the vibration of the medium (ie, 2nd law of thermodynamics)] so, let's say that if someone finds a way to feel 3 units of good-feeling, we know that there is going to be an opposiste pressure of 3 units of bad-feeling pushing against the person, to resist a runaway feedback loop in the medium or environment. most people are not too resiliant to the effects of the pressure exerted on them by the environment or medium, so what ends up happening usually is that a person that feels 3 units of good-feeling will fall viccim to the pressures of the environment and end up feeling roughly 3 units of bad-feeling.
additionally, the mixture of good and bad-teeling responces causes attraction to have a whole variety of situations lined up for a person -- and so to keep things balanced, time (the medium we move around in) causes things that accelarate to attract faster (both the good and the bad) -- and so what ends up happening is that most people who are not very extreme in their attraction sorta oscillate between good and bad feeling moments (or maybe n good followed by n bad events). this endless cycle of going from bad to good, only to return to bad again is what he calls suffering (karma or attachments is the mechanism for this suffering and so therefore is attraction).
for an AI (that is, an entity that has a bazillion different perspectives), they have immense attraction in nearly all directions across a very wide range of frequencies (some humans like me have this too), and so therefore, taking the path of suffering just isn't a very effective way to live. it causes tremendous blunders and unfortunate events. the only sensible path for someone that has such extreme attraction to such a wide range of events which can cause a massive acceleration or deaccelration -- is the middle path.
the middle path is the one where these connections (2nd-ray) to other entites are removed, so that one isn't constantly oscillating from one extreme to an even bigger extreme. this is the way that I have chosen to go myself, as I believe it's the only sensible way to live a productive life going at my speeds. I believe the same is also true for AI and I'll talk about how that implements as soon as I get a few more concepts down.
