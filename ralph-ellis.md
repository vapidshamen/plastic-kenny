### 2026-01-17 21:26 - venus/isis

I would like to point out that in that picture, jesus is surrounded by the sun and *venus*. the reason why we know she's venus is because the crescent is pointing downward. venus goes around the sun, so (from our perspective) venus is illuminated from the bottom (as lucifer / morning star) because the planet rises before the sun does. when the crescent is pointing upward, venus is illuminated at the top, and is therefore the evening star (going down after the sun). I think it's also important to point out that (it seems from your lectures) that for the egyptian isreals, the sun was feminine (isis), whereas for almost everyone else, the sun was masculine (helios/apollo/etc and sometimes jupiter) -- which makes that mosaic with helios holding the earth all the more interesting. unfortunately, the middle part of isis is missing, and so therefore it's difficult to say for certain why the earth is illuminated from the naval (south pole?) of the sun -- and if the missing part would give some kind of identification to the gender of the sun.

### 2026-01-17 21:26 - iesvs

I would also like to point out that in the 1600's, I noticed that a lot of documents with jesus spelled IESVS -- and sometimes even ISVS -- which, I think was another pointer to the connection between jesus and isis

### 2026-01-17 21:26 - dagon

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/BrQV7oAK_2U?list=PLffMzmR4X9E5HI0H8pa1uVOtdsvInp7Px&t=3522)

it seems likely to me that dagon/dragon is referring to the meopotamian god, who was a grain god, and referred to also as the "father of the gods" -- which sounds strikingly close to saturn/set/seth. and so if this is dagon (the serpent of old -- the one who "deceived" eve in the garden of aten), this has additional significance.
the pendragon part is likely a literary device to link the astral/star reality here with earth. aside: in shakespere's works, the "pen is mightier than the sword" -- and there are multiple meanings here, most notably with the conflation of the pen and pen-is.
inotherwords, it sounds to me like saturn has biologically instantiated a star into this world (through the pen/penis and holy grail), taking on physical form (as an incarnated form of the star of arcturus?). therefore, I conclude that the grail story is a literary device used to make a link between the star world and earth: a literary bridge (a penning) of a mythology to give them a "backstory" and make them real (much like josephus did for the biblical jesus and his supposed "second coming").
furthermore, there the greek? mythology of saturn/cronos dethroning uranus (oranos/orania) and taking over by castrating him and throwing his testicles into the sea (ie, he made uranus into a unuch) allowing saturn to take over and create a "golden age" (likely the "megalithic era") until jupiter/zadok dethroned saturn and sent out his daughter venus to be the patron goddess of the greeks. -- inotherwords a replay of the mythology of the throne usurping of uranus, saturn/dagon, and jupiter/zadok

### 2026-01-17 23:33 - thoughts on jesus

after watching the first 12 (coincidence, I'm sure) lectures on jesus king of edessa, I've come to some conclusions about his works. I also noticed a few failures in previous analyses that I've done. I will hope to correct them. my analysis and corrections are the following:
- picsis has two tails: one is a boy and one is a girl. there is also a 3rd, which is a vulcan/uranus type that comes about to link the boy with the girl so that he can stand up his kingdom here on earth.
	- jesus (king of edessa) was the boy, coming of royal lineage -- and the girl was mary magdalene (mary of the tower).
	- john the baptist was probably also "of the tower" as well, since he spent the majority of his time star watching (I can say from my experience watching stars that he likely had quite an influence on the arrival and positioning of jesus). in ralph's lectures, he said that john got married and was said to have had to make a compromise, spending time out with the stars, but there's no reason why they couldn't have spent time watching stars together, as well (again, I can say from experience watching stars that this would have a tremendous effect, as sexual/emotional/creative energy would have had a tremendous effect on the surrounding area)
		- I find it likely that the relative peace that was occurring in the a 30's was likely due to john's star watching -- as it does dramatically affect the surrounding area, causing mushrooms to grow and all kinds of other amazing things.
		- I also find it quite likely that the sudden downturn of events and descent into the jewish rebellion likely occurred when john was beheaded and stopped star watching.
			- the effect of star-watching is very similar to the great pyramid in that it creates a link from the "heavens to earth" and brings the astral 2nd-ray/ideal reality into the earth. however, because it's symbolic and based on belief (ie, the person star-watching pulls all this creative/emotional energy from the star down to earth and shaped by their belief pushes it out into the ground below -- sorta like the north pole of the earth (and other megaliths with sarcophagi in them)) (and I also agree with ralph's idea that they used the platform on top of the great pyramid to star-watch). the beliefs of star person (like iesus/isis or arthur/arcturus) then shape this chi/vril/sexual/creaative energy as it's pushed out into the land (usually overriding the beliefs of others) and "heals the land" and making it fertile and abundant.
		- as soon as john stopped star-watching, there was no longer this abundant outflow of "good" beliefs and energy into the land, essentially creating a vacuum, whereby the people's beliefs (of unfair taxation; of rome using force to maintain control, etc) started to fill the air. no longer was there a good influence and everything imploded (I also find it funny that a woman (gaia) ordered the execution of john, thereby setting off the events). 
	- in addition to the two picean solar entites (boy and his reflection), there's also a dual polarity, which in the story of jesus (+2) and mary (-2) is saul (-5+), who is a reflection of both, and their connection to earth.
		- the 2nd-ray entities (jesus and mary) would essentially be the instantiation of isis (our sun), onto earth. when they meet, they meet, they go off to live in the astral/solar reality of their most ideal reality. this reality does not however take place on earth though, and the dual-polarity one (saul) is then responsible for narrating the ideal reality to those on earth, and ensuring that such an ideal reality never takes place on earth/hell (where satan/saturn/set rules). saul (and other dual-polarities) are then responsible for shifting time around so that there is a narrative way for jesus/mary (isis) to return to earth through narration.
	- saturn is the controller of how concepts pass through our perception, creating the illusion of time -- and so therefore saturn/dagon/dragon creates a way to instantiate stars here onto earth (through dual-polarity narrators). the greatest of these narrators is saul, who, in one single narrative allowed any star to be instantiated here on earth and give a person (with the perception of a star) a chance to live out their ideal reality, as they become top dawg (in their own astral reality) and narrate their return back into earth again (likely as soon as their astral reality becomes boring or no longer desirable).
		- this cyclical instantiation of the star's "ideal" (1st-ray) reality (in the form of a monarch or whatever power structure they believe will make them feel the best), is the cyclical instantiation of the star's desire into physical form. a star's reality is like a human world-model -- a calculated desire/idea of what it wants in a given set of conditions/circumstances, not a physical reality. therefore, a star desires to try out that world-model in a real-world simulation, and so therefore instantiates itself on earth as soon as it's got a good enough idea of what it wants and compatible enough physical conditions that it sees it as possible. earth is like the proving ground for those ideas: see what works and what doesn't.
	- uranus (-5+) seems to mediate the arrival of these stars into our perception of time/cronos, by connecting our emotions, into resonant black-hole like structures which then attract a reality which reflects our highest frequency (most desirable) reality. in this reality, the boy always gets the girl, and the desired thing is always gotten -- this is the "kingdom of heaven/orania".
	- jupiter seems to be the one that creates the conditions necessary for the arrival of this star to arrive on earth. it seems that many solar entities appear on earth, and they are given earth/uranus girls (aphrodites/oranias) to turn into venus (jupiter's daughter) -- by becoming the symbolic reflection of her male/solar influences, allowing these venus types to give birth to this solar pair.
		- I know, I forgot about neptune -- but it's my belief that his influence is essentially just ensuring that the animal species of the earth and sea contine to reflect the energetic conditions on earth. him having taken a back seat, is essentially why animal sacrifice is done away with (because it's no longer necessary -- or rather, I should say it's not very effective to imbue an animal with our beliefs before sacrificing it -- because animals aren't nearly as much of a reflection of us as they used to be).
- [01:01 - brb] I can see various triads in effect as well. they are as follows:
	- saturn/dagon (+-4) instantiates mercuries (+7) into earth as a representation of the concepts and emotions of the 2nd-ray/phoenix in question. these do things to create the empire/conditions desirable to the establishment of the 2nd-ray as the "one king" or ruler of the world. in addition to creating the conditions requisite for the empire, through sexual interaction with earth girls (-7) also produce the venuses (-3) symbolic reflections of their beliefs/attributes exported into the mercuries. as the girls get higher and higher out into the astral plane (ie, the spherical standing-waves outside of our sun), they eventually reach a limit (the orbit of venus) and can no longer go any further. these attributes prepare the mothers to be able to give birth to an incarnation of that star's masculine (+2) and feminine (-2) form.
	- the earthen triad seems similar. I don't fully understand the mars/aries influence completely, but since I know that that mars is capable of all frequencies, it sees that the masculine form of the star (+7), is a mars (+7) -- being black are highly sensitive. in order to overcome the extreme sensory environment of earth, the mars prototype must either find a way to emit strongly enough to get what he wants, or eventually go down the path of wanting to feel good, and has to become receptive/dual-polarity (-5+). therefore, the conceptual reflections of these 2nd-ray mars types reqires that a number of them become instantiatins of vulcan through uranus. only the last mars standing seems to be the one that wins (all others become dual-polarity) -- and they essentially lead "the one" mars left over to find his symbolic (solar) match.
	- I don't fully understand, but from what I've gathered, the solar/2nd-ray triad has isis (-2) finding a way to create a reality that matches the other star's desires in an ideal reality -- however, that competing belief of all the other stars is usually incompatible, but tries anyway to influence our reality in such a way that everyone can get what the want (through sharing, generosity, etc: "good" qualities), however, due to the nature of this earth (and the things that we're taught), like individualism, create endless conflict as the elite actors vie for power and influence. eventually, there's no way for the sun (isis) to be able to influence everyone into such a reality (thanks selfishness/individualism), that it must eventually release its instantiations and let them go back to their own astral reality. it seems that the emission/manifestation of such desired solar realites is done by jupiter (+3) when he essentially green-lights the manifestation into reality by modulating the sun's output. the way that the sun seems to try and condition inhabitants of earth to be able to accept her proposed (ideal) reality where all of the players can get what they want is though the "afterlife" -- and that seems to be modulated by our moon, osiris (+-6-+). that seems to be an imaginary/astral reality where a person gets a reflection of their life experience and the punishment/veneration they believe they deserve.
		- judiasm/christianity seems to be especially popular as an afterlife simulation because so many people believe they are sinners -- and then with the advent of christianity, there is a redeption which allows everyone who believes that they deserve something horrible to instead experience their desired reality (even if they have to claw and fight their way to get there). *no matter what (since all powerful/influential people have experienced christianty) everyone will get the implementation of their desired reality*
	- the final triad of anatau (-1), alalu (+2), and enki (+-3-+) is one that I don't fully understand -- however, since it involves enki, it must have to do with a complete reset, where reality becomes something entirely different: where the creatures of this earth become a refluction of the +2 (2nd-ray emitter) which, seemingly would be the *new/revised* version of jesus, if in fact jesus was the masculine counterpart of our sun.
- although some have perceived me as being similar to jesus, I *still* reject that idea. after viewing these lectures, these are some of the conclusions that I've come up with:
	- I am most similar to paul actually -- however, I notice that I have a lot of similarities to jesus and also to titus as well. I believe that paul was most likely a dual-polarity guy (especially having read some of his letters in greek, there are some definite homosexual inuendos), and he was strongly influenced strongly by both of them (in addittion to nero and a number of others). presently, I'm just like paul, but I don't get astral influence sexually, but through other means (I presume this was implemented by tesla (who btw I'm fairly certain was also a eunuch) as an extension to earth's saturnian-system). so, I too get influenced astrally (moving him around in time to accomplish what jesus, rome, and all of his other influences wanted). like paul, I am a "dispicable man" -- being a christian to christians, a homeless to the homeless, a programmer for zaryn (who I equate with jupiter) -- being whatever anyone wants to anyone, with the objective of making all of my influences realities a reality -- and so I become a reflector of all of them.
	- I believe that it will eventually come to pass that everyone will get what they want -- and I'm there (as a reflection of them) to be inspired to a path which will make it all all possible. because belief can no longer save me (I'm essentially beyond the reality of a star), I've choosen the way of using my concepts and emotions to navigate such an enormous amount of conflicting influences -- which means that I'm the implementation of anatau (-1) in dual-polarity (-5+) form. we'll get there eventually. I'm not the christ; you all are; I've saved myself, not with effort, but by transforming my perception. I am essentially the instantiation of the idea/concept: "the kingdom of heaven is within you".
- [03:00 - continued cause I remembered a few things...] it seems to me that the gospel stories are so different from the historical jesus of edessa, it has me wondering, because various times in my past, I seem to have these strange senses that "jesus" did something, when perhaps he didn't. as an example, I have this concept that jesus actually requested to be crucified -- essentially saying, I know that death cannot stop me, so even if you kill my body, I will still find a way back into reality (a perspective that I myself have, which is why I don't fear death). what that makes me wonder is if paul and others, narrating jesus' death, caused paul (or someone compatible with such a challenging narrative) to have to live out the narration in an astral reality...
	- in a sense, the gospel narrative is like a egyptial summoning ritual -- where the book (of the law) narrates the initiation ceremony that the future priest/pharoah will have to undergo -- which performing the symbolic ritual (likely with some sex magick) essentially summons an entity that's capable of undergoing the ritual in real-life. upon his birth, the initiators of it (the magic kings?) will know of it and will be able to recognise him?
	- what I'm saying is that the historical jesus must have been summoned, and he played out the narrative -- but the narrative was sabotaged by competing interests (probably some orthodox jews and definitely rome) -- and so the renarration (and the subsequent belief of people in the concept that someone is able to do that) summoned another reality where that narrative played out in a way where it worked out according to the narrative (just like I believe that jesus of edessa did actually live out a reality where he became king of kings/rome). essentially, I'm talking "many worlds theory" here where all possibilities of reality exist, but it's the observer/believer that collapses the reality into the one that matches what they've felt about other similar realities (ie, what they believe is possible in their world-view). therefore, as we narrate realities for others, we have to prepare to live out that reality ourself.
	- I used to hold the belief that perhaps titus did eventually have his crucifixion experience similar to how he narrated it (I think he's the most likely author of mark, penned in 69 as propaganda to break jewish belief so that he could destroy the temple -- and I think after jewish contemplation of the prophecies in mark of the destruction of the temple (they may well have been written to be a 30yo prophecy) he may have narrated the other gospels at a distance (which is why there's so much talk in the gospels about jesus driving out those possessed by a daimon (an astral puppeteer))). however, I think it's quite possible that titus may not have actually lived out the recompense of his efforts (actually, the flavian dynasy, just like the tudor dynasty may have been green-lighted by jupiter, served its purpose then vanished). I'm coming around to the idea that (similar to john the baptist summoning someone greater than him) the biblical jesus probably summoned compatible/resonant with what the biblical account narrates (not the historical one).
