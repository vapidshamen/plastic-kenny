I would like to point out that in that picture, jesus is surrounded by the sun and *venus*. the reason why we know she's venus is because the crescent is pointing downward. venus goes around the sun, so (from our perspective) venus is illuminated from the bottom (as lucifer / morning star) because the planet rises before the sun does. when the crescent is pointing upward, venus is illuminated at the top, and is therefore the evening star (going down after the sun). I think it's also important to point out that (it seems from your lectures) that for the egyptian isreals, the sun was feminine (isis), whereas for almost everyone else, the sun was masculine (helios/apollo/etc and sometimes jupiter) -- which makes that mosaic with helios holding the earth all the more interesting. unfortunately, the middle part of isis is missing, and so therefore it's difficult to say for certain why the earth is illuminated from the naval (south pole?) of the sun -- and if the missing part would give some kind of identification to the gender of the sun.

I would also like to point out that in the 1600's, I noticed that a lot of documents with jesus spelled IESVS -- and sometimes even ISVS -- which, I think was another pointer to the connection between jesus and isis

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/BrQV7oAK_2U?list=PLffMzmR4X9E5HI0H8pa1uVOtdsvInp7Px&t=3522)

it seems likely to me that dagon/dragon is referring to the meopotamian god, who was a grain god, and referred to also as the "father of the gods" -- which sounds strikingly close to saturn/set/seth. and so if this is dagon (the serpent of old -- the one who "deceived" eve in the garden of aten), this has additional significance.
the pendragon part is likely a literary device to link the astral/star reality here with earth. aside: in shakespere's works, the "pen is mightier than the sword" -- and there are multiple meanings here, most notably with the conflation of the pen and pen-is.
inotherwords, it sounds to me like saturn has biologically instantiated a star into this world (through the pen/penis and holy grail), taking on physical form (as an incarnated form of the star of arcturus?). therefore, I conclude that the grail story is a literary device used to make a link between the star world and earth: a literary bridge (a penning) of a mythology to give them a "backstory" and make them real (much like josephus did for the biblical jesus and his supposed "second coming").
furthermore, there the greek? mythology of saturn/cronos dethroning uranus (oranos/orania) and taking over by castrating him and throwing his testicles into the sea (ie, he made uranus into a unuch) allowing saturn to take over and create a "golden age" (likely the "megalithic era") until jupiter/zadok dethroned saturn and sent out his daughter venus to be the patron goddess of the greeks. -- inotherwords a replay of the mythology of the throne usurping of uranus, saturn/dagon, and jupiter/zadok

### 2026-01-17 23:33 - thoughts on jesus

after watching the first 12 (coincidence, I'm sure) lectures on jesus king of edessa, I've come to some conclusions about his works. I also noticed a few failures in previous analyses that I've done. I will hope to correct them. my analysis and corrections are the following:
- picsis has two tails: one is a boy and one is a girl. there is also a 3rd, which is a vulcan/uranus type that comes about to link the boy with the girl so that he can stand up his kingdom here on earth.
	- jesus (king of edessa) was the boy, coming of royal lineage -- and the girl was mary magdalene (mary of the tower).
	- john the baptist was probably also "of the tower" as well, since he spent the majority of his time star watching (I can say from my experience watching stars that he likely had quite an influence on the arrival and positioning of jesus). in ralph's lectures, he said that john got married and was said to have had to make a compromise, spending time out with the stars, but there's no reason why they couldn't have spent time watching stars together, as well (again, I can say from experience watching stars that this would have a tremendous effect, as sexual/emotional/creative energy would have had a tremendous effect on the surrounding area)
		- I find it likely that the relative peace that was occurring in the a 30's was likely due to john's star watching -- as it does dramatically affect the surrounding area, causing mushrooms to grow and all kinds of other amazing things.
		- I also find it quite likely that the sudden downturn of events and descent into the jewish rebellion likely occurred when john was beheaded and stopped star watching.
			- the effect of star-watching is very similar to the great pyramid in that it creates a link from the "heavens to earth" and brings the astral 2nd-ray/ideal reality into the earth. however, because it's symbolic and based on belief (ie, the person star-watching pulls all this creative/emotional energy from the star down to earth and shaped by their belief pushes it out into the ground below -- sorta like the north pole of the earth (and other megaliths with sarcophagi in them)) (and I also agree with ralph's idea that they used the platform on top of the great pyramid to star-watch). the beliefs of star person (like iesus/isis or arthur/arcturus) then shape this chi/vril/sexual/creaative energy as it's pushed out into the land (usually overriding the beliefs of others) and "heals the land" and making it fertile and abundant.
		- as soon as john stopped star-watching, there was no longer this abundant outflow of "good" beliefs and energy into the land, essentially creating a vacuum, whereby the people's beliefs (of unfair taxation; of rome using force to maintain control, etc) started to fill the air. no longer was there a good influence and everything imploded (I also find it funny that a woman (gaia) ordered the execution of john, thereby setting off the events). 
	- in addition to the two picean solar entites (boy and his reflection), there's also a dual polarity, which in the story of jesus (+2) and mary (-2) is saul (-5+), who is a reflection of both, and their connection to earth.
		- the 2nd-ray entities (jesus and mary) would essentially be the instantiation of isis (our sun), onto earth. when they meet, they meet, they go off to live in the astral/solar reality of their most ideal reality. this reality does not however take place on earth though, and the dual-polarity one (saul) is then responsible for narrating the ideal reality to those on earth, and ensuring that such an ideal reality never takes place on earth/hell (where satan/saturn/set rules). saul (and other dual-polarities) are then responsible for shifting time around so that there is a narrative way for jesus/mary (isis) to return to earth through narration.
	- saturn is the controller of how concepts pass through our perception, creating the illusion of time -- and so therefore saturn/dagon/dragon creates a way to instantiate stars here onto earth (through dual-polarity narrators). the greatest of these narrators is saul, who, in one single narrative allowed any star to be instantiated here on earth and give a person (with the perception of a star) a chance to live out their ideal reality, as they become top dawg (in their own astral reality) and narrate their return back into earth again (likely as soon as their astral reality becomes boring or no longer desirable).
		- this cyclical instantiation of the star's "ideal" (1st-ray) reality (in the form of a monarch or whatever power structure they believe will make them feel the best), is the cyclical instantiation of the star's desire into physical form. a star's reality is like a human world-model -- a calculated desire/idea of what it wants in a given set of conditions/circumstances, not a physical reality. therefore, a star desires to try out that world-model in a real-world simulation, and so therefore instantiates itself on earth as soon as it's got a good enough idea of what it wants and compatible enough physical conditions that it sees it as possible. earth is like the proving ground for those ideas: see what works and what doesn't.
	- uranus (-5+) seems to mediate the arrival of these stars into our perception of time/cronos, by connecting our emotions, into resonant black-hole like structures which then attract a reality which reflects our highest frequency (most desirable) reality. in this reality, the boy always gets the girl, and the desired thing is always gotten -- this is the "kingdom of heaven/orania".
	- jupiter seems to be the one that creates the conditions necessary for the arrival of this star to arrive on earth. it seems that many solar entities appear on earth, and they are given earth/uranus girls (aphrodites/oranias) to turn into venus (jupiter's daughter) -- by becoming the symbolic reflection of her male/solar influences, allowing these venus types to give birth to this solar pair.
		- I know, I forgot about neptune -- but it's my belief that his influence is essentially just ensuring that the animal species of the earth and sea contine to reflect the energetic conditions on earth. him having taken a back seat, is essentially why animal sacrifice is done away with (because it's no longer necessary -- or rather, I should say it's not very effective to imbue an animal with our beliefs before sacrificing it -- because animals aren't nearly as much of a reflection of us as they used to be).
