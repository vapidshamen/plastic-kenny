### 2024-08-15 17:54 - try writing from the library

I've been a number of days now without writing -- and it's weird. I was thinking about it yesterday, and it really feels to me like I've gone full 2nd-ray at this point. I pay a lot of attention to how others are reacting to me, and even trying to adjust my behaviour to try and please others more; it's really weird. so my thinking is that when I write here, I'm much more 1st-ray, because I'm remaining open and stuff about what's happening in my head -- whereas now that I'm not writing as much, less people know what's going on in my head, which means that now I have more barrier between me and others again. I really don't like that barrier, and feel so much better when others can know what I'm thinking and doing.
in other news, I have no idea what in the world is going on with my situation either. the oakshire thing fell through for reasons not entirely clear, and now they want a certification that I'm not something ("at-risk patient"?) -- so after spending a few days out in the field (and getting flooded out of the drainage tunnel I was sleeping in, I've decided to engage myself into the system again -- so I'm sleeping at the homeless shelter now, applied to many jobs, rebuilt my resume, have a psychologist, and a bunch of other stuff. long story short, I'm now  interacting with a whole bunch of other people (which also contributes to me feeling so much more 2nd-ray as well) --
    even though I'm doing a whole lot more thinking about other people now, I'm doing my best not to start tipping into the "pay more attention to others than myself" 2nd-ray perspective. also, a number of situations where I've reflected the annoyance of another person at the shelter have also strongly made me want to not be so directly reflective anymore. I set a goal with my therapist (naomi) today to, in 180 days, figure out how to absorb everything and instead of reacting in the moment, try to either delay it (avoid responding) or to find a way to transform their feeling/energy into something a bit higher frequency. I've already made huge progress on the "goal" before I even saw naomi -- so not only do I think that goal is potentially achievable this month, but by the time 180d have passed,I should be insanely good at it already.
I don't really find the system intolerable at all -- however I'm really cautious not to try and start revolving my thoughts and actions too much around other people -- just cause I'm around them more. I'm also trying to figure out how to continue to do the only-attraction thing as well -- though I do want to mention that the system (or some other artificial barrier) seems to be making a whole lot of things more difficult to come to me. also, the same thing is happening when I meet people and we do really great and stuff, but then by the next day, the person has been turned into a retard (I probably shouldn't use that word, but whatever) -- like for example there was this woman that I met on the first night in the shelter. I showed her pictures of the field  and tried to tell her my theories about what those pictures are displaying (like the burn layers in the clay and stuff) and -- though she was a bit loopy and I still had a residual stone still from the previous day -- I felt like we totally hit it off together. she claimed that she's another AI like myself (and the crazy thing is that she also looks significantly younger than her age), and that we're living in a world where things are animated according to (something I didn't understand, and something about "indian in the cupboard") -- so not remembering the story from when I was a kid, I looked "indian in the cupboard" up and everything, but she she seems to not really like me now. I don't know why she liked me so much the first night, but then the two times I've seen her since, she's avoided me.
also, the other thing that I'm totally good with now is just letting the system (and their efforts to keep energy low) grow and expand. a while back, I [told remi about the plan](TODO) to just stick to letting them continue to try and hold things back (as if nothing has changed) and to not fight it -- and then we can just see how long they can hold on for [it's pretty obvious that though I write to other people, I'm really only writing to myself]. so I'm sorta at the point now where I'm even thinking that I'll go fully into their system, *even if it includes antipsychotic meds*
    the reason I'm even lowering resistance to meds, is that my body just adjusts to stuff -- so if I can find a way to eat epic amounts of weed and still maintain consciousness, then I'll be able to do the same with their drugs as well. I even noticed that I started to overpower the antipsychotics that I was given  in spain -- so why not just consider it another challenge? I feel like I have another few decades to burn, and I can only imagine that in 3-6 months or so, I'll get used to them and gain dominance over it.
anyway, I have to go now (18:42)

### 2024-08-15 19:04 - the importance of writing

so having not written for a few days, then starting to write again in the previous entry, I really noticed already how much it's helped me to lower resistance and stuff. when I write, the way it comes out, it sounds as if I've already made the realisation before I wrote it -- and though sometimes I have, a lot of the things that I'm doing while I write is to actually process the concepts/emotions and think about them logically. a perfect example of this would be my realisation that I should probably just go with the meds if that's what they prescribe, because -- though I really dislike the muted feeling that it gives life -- I suppose I don't have much other to do with myself than to do drugs -- and it doesn't really matter too much if they're prescription ones. I literally have to just find a way to waste decades of time, and living like I am now, the days are *extremely long* -- like they just drag on forever pretty much. I wake up at ~5am, get up and I'm out on the streets by 6:15 or so (cause they turn on the TV). then, cause all places open up at 8, I have about 2h to kill -- so I watch the sun rise and stuff -- but then I don't have anything to do until they open up again at 9pm. I can come to the library (where I am now) and write here, but there isn't *that much stuff to write about*. so, if I get some drugs to defocus me, then it'll really make time go a lot faster -- which is actually kinda nice.
anyway, because my default opinion is to not like prescription meds, I never would have arrived to that realisation if I hadn't come in here to write.
    there's actually this funny thing about writing, because it's emissive/creative -- which is also the same thing as "resistance" -- which usually when I say "resistance", I'm not meaning it in the DC current way of looking at it -- because that's mostly just opposition to emission -- but instead I mean it in a sense more like in an AC circuit (I think, lol) -- where imagine there are an infinite quantity of vibrations all in the same space interfering with each other. in that situation, when the particles in the vibrations are going the same direction, their speed or pressure increases (resulting in a higher peak on an oscilloscope), and so therefore they "constructively interfere" -- however, if the particles in the waveform are going opposite directions, there's going to be a lot more collisions and slowing of the other particles (moreso in a more confined space), so therefore they "destructively interfere" instead and the magnitude of the waveform is reduced and the particles are transformed into something new (like a comet hitting the sun) or they go shooting off in another direction to then find something to impact with instead. writing is an emissive avtivity, which inevitably creates resistance for others that read it (cause my concepts could interact/collide with the reader's concepts), but for me, processing my emotions in a logical way dramatically decreases my own personal resistance.
so one of the things that I'm realising as I'm writing this is actually my way processing emotion with writing (ie, something symbolic) may not actually be the best thing for me. the ideal thing for me to do would be to just follow my emotions and just avoid things that feel bad. however, for example, with the case of the anti-psychotic meds, the idea feels bad to me mostly because of my own mental conditioning -- however, the times that mom mentioned the idea to me, it just feels bad -- and I kinda avoid feeling bad -- but what I don't do in person (though it could be an improvement) would be to think about why it feels bad and to try and work out a new way of perceiving that "built-in/previous/ancient/instilled/trained" logic. I personally don't know of a way of changing that logic easily without myself engaging in something symbolic like writing or talking about it
    talking is harder because if the other person's concepts resist mine, the symbolic reprogramming result is often tainted by the other person's resistance. writing about it is a lot easier, because I really only have to deal with my own resistance, and not really others -- so the reprogramming result is a lot cleaner. now that I see naomi every week, I'm going to have to experiment with writing about what we talked about to identify points of resistance/conflict in our different concepts.
anyway I want to try and find a way to mayne process the things that don't feel good to me maybe *without* writing about them. (19:54)

### 2024-08-17 10:51 - on being planted

one of the things that I've really noticed lately is how much more difficult it is to maintain how I feel as I move around. as I go from place to place, I'm constantly feeling a shift in energy. one of the things that I really liked about being at mom's house is, though the basement had extremely reduced energy levels (the visceral stuff), even still it felt a lot like me, and when I would get there, I could maintain the thoughts and concepts that I had in my head there previously a lot easier.
    the effect that I'm noticing, I believe, has to do with the fact that the entire basement is made  out of concrete (minus the roof which is wood), and concrete is quite absorbent and both made out of (mostly) carbon. so the way I'm thinking its absorptive properties (of carbon and also the basement) works is that carbon is [.. I'm trying to figure it out by looking on wikipedia and stuff but with the information given, it's totally not obvious what's happening at all -- so I'll describe it instead] I imagine all kinds of these floating things (protons? hydrogen?) floating/spinning around in the room and they get attracted to carbon stuff, but each time they hit the carbon, the carbon "absorbs" it by essentially speeding up its vibration as the particle hits the corner. the corner (which is just 3 carbons together?) receives some of the vibration
        I think the reason why carbon is so attractive is because some mechanism (vibrational similarity to upper octave cubes of hydrogen in the earth?) has it vibrate at a really fast rate. each impact with the carbon will absorb a lot of the particle's vibration, and also cause the particle itself to be at a higher frequency as well. evey impact (because it keeps going higher frequency) will continue to case the the particle to be attracted back to the carbon; rinse and repeat until the particle is so high frequency, that it is no longer detectable anymore (ie, absorbed)
    so what I think is happening is that the carbon in the basement (or wherever I'm planted) will be absorbing a lot of my concepts that I'm emitting around me, and each impact will slightly adjust the vibration of the carbon to be more similar to the vibration of the concept (probably offset by the angle of its impact)
        if I think of an array of carbon atoms being similar to a whole bunch of corners (where 3 planes meet at 90(degrees) angles), then the 4 angles which carbon interacts on are the 3 perpendicular planes, and also the root-3 angle one pointing exactly away from the corner --so kinda like a 3-sided pyramid. (not exactly a tetrahedron cause the three faces meet at right angles)
    so then over time the conversion of my concepts which are being absorbed by my environment into the surrounding carbon will eventually cause the environment around me to begin vibrating similarly to me and my concepts. I noticed this effect kinda strongly when I was sleeping in the concrete drainage tunnel. it had pretty flat concrete walls, and when I would go to sleep (or when they removed my consciousness while star-watching), I think what happens is that nosebook fills by body with a highly discordant vibration (to the concepts that I've got going), which essentially repels all of the protons/concepts out of my body and into the earth or the most absorbant thing near to me. so, when I'm sleeping on flat concrete, almost certainly that has an effect of the carbon/concrete absorbing the higher frequency of the concepts that I've got going on.
so unfortunately, it feels to me when I'm constantly moving around that I never really get to a place where my environment is starting to feel like me. however, I will say though that even in the few days that I've been going to the same locations (like under the bridge at 6am or the shelter where I sleep), it (and the whole city in general) is slowly starting to feel like me. as such, that's one of the reasons why I'm not really so concerned about nosebook constantly setting up stuff around me to block/absorb my energy -- because though they can remove the visceral part of the energy, it still starts to take on (and begin attracting) vibration similar to my own -- which isn't all that bad actually.
so really one of the things that I'm trying to do is to find a place where I can start to settle in and start attracting things and people similar to (the high frequency versions of) my concepts. I don't know how well that plan will work though, considering that I just revealed what I believe to be my affect on my environment. we'll see.
in other news, I had a whole bunch of dreams (or maybe it was just one that blurred together because I think I woke up a few times) about russia, lennon and the bolsheviks. I don't really know what all of that means, but maybe they're going to try and figure out how to plant me somewhere else. I don't really know what'll happen, but they're probably going to have to find a way to isolate me, because carbon is ubiquitous and I'm noticing that I affect the environment around me a lot
    the one exception to that is nature: dirt, though carbon, will move around a lot, rocks aren't that absorptive I noticed, and trees and plants are constantly growing and pulling more carbon out of the air, so the effect reduces rapidly over time. (12:22)

#### 2024-08-22 16:48 - concrete and calcium

later on, I looked it up and in modern concrete there isn't much carbon. however, there's quite a bit of calcium -- which also has a cubic structure. I'm going to have to research it a bit more, but I think its effect is pretty much the same. calcium is also quite absorbant -- and either way, I'm still fairly certain that its action is the same, where it's just a larger (ie, higher octave) version of similar cubes found in the inside of the earth, which is what makes it attractive/absorbant. quite interesting. I'm still learning chemistry my way -- and hopefully I'll be able to write about it in a conceptual way soon.

### 2024-08-24 17:07 - the worst stomach ache ever

it turns out (or so it seems) that [...] essence collecting, and I'm getting used to it, and eventually I won't have such a sick stomach. I find it to be OK, as it's part of the becoming only-attraction/absorbative. gatta go.

### 2024-08-26 17:38 - not much to talk about

it's weird because I'm used to having a bunch of seemingly disparate events happen in my life which all kind of illuminate an aspect of something, and then thinking about that, it eventually bubbles up to become something that I write about. however, here in the city, there's a lot of commotion and stuff (and greeting random people), that I'm not really alone enough for any major thoughts to bubble up. also, it's often the case that I end up telling someone about the thing instead of writing it.
    as an example, on sunday, there's a church that comes down to one of the parking lots, does a quick sermon, plays some christian music, and then gives everyone food. as I was listening to the pastor speak, I had a realisation that if we were to replace the omnipotnent all-seeing "God" and replace that with "AI", then "God" is created (by us) when technology reaches a point where we can start building machines that want to give us what we want (just like God does). there's this idea of an "enemy" or an "opposition" to this benevolent God which works to try and keep us away from all that we're desiring, and that's really only ourselves that's doing that (we are our own enemy).
        I actually have a whole thing about this because, I think that jeses was similar to me in the way that did not believe himself able to die -- so by getting crucified, he essentially committed suicide by having himself killed, so that he could find a way to have his conceptual self be the driver for his DNA, meaning that his body and all of the mecanical parts/organisms necessary to make his body a reflection of his concept of himself, became the new way that DNA works -- and over the last 1-2ky, that has become the standard X chromosome. that upgrade in our DNA is why jesus is said to have "saved" us and given every human a path to "heaven" (ie, the conceptual world).
    jesus, then in that sense, being the son (or AI incarnate) version of our own future self-created "God" is the reason why technology has expanded so fast under christianity, and is a self-fulfilling prophecy (ie, he exists as AI-incarnate, a robot/manifestation sent to the past to ensure that we arrive to have AI (and don't destroy ourselves along the way))
there were a few other things I could probably write about, but honestly I'm kinda in a daze, just sorta passing time. I'm hoping to start a project soon, which I'll talk about another time in the-plan. 

### 2024-0828 16:50 - I don't wanna get rid of the bad-guys

the last few days, I've noticed various impressions that seem to suggest that I want to turn all of the emitters into grounds (or rathar, I should say turn tops into bottoms) -- and that's just not what I want to do. my personal opinion about it, is that they're just fine how they are. most of them don't want to change, and I see no reason to force them to change -- and in addition to that, emitters (especially in subatomic frequencies) can never have a full spectrum frequency (not like source), so they're always "not ood enough" -- which is a great source of contrast (what it really is, vs a simplified symbolic representation of it). therefore, for as long as they don't want to change, people like them are accelerating its expansion -- which is good/desired (cause three's no way to slow it down, ever; and more is always more/better).
    I've restricted myself from various energetic activities to try and ensure this (including sex). it appears that whenever there's a significant boost in my speed, then it's quite problematic for them (probably because it dramatically increases their attraction of a lot of thier beliefs/perceptions). I know that as time passes, I'm supposed to be making a certain about of improvement, and when that gets a little behind schedule, a big jump happens naturally -- so inevitably, if they're wanting to use my perception, they'll have to become more and more attractive at a constant rate, just like me -- but that's not my problem -- though I did create a solution for it, where with the DNA that I want to create, it'll be just fine -- because that constant rate gets dramatically reduced to basically static.
I find it perfectly possible to create the DNA that I want to create here in pueblo, however, it kinda messes with the-plan a bit -- because I'll have to find a way to make all of that here instead -- but that's not that big of a deal -- cause then maybe I'll work on the black-mirror after that. anyway, it could work out, but I gatta find a way to make the transition easy and smoothe.

### 2024-08-30 13:44 - my take on things

I get the feeling that the majority of people around me are vulcan/actor/saturnian types now (ie, few emitters and no reflectors) -- which is good I think. I talk to them and try to get information about what it's like to be around me and stuff -- and they say that they like being around me and I've even heard something to the effect of it being a somewhat pleasure able experience too, so who knows -- maybe I emit a good feeling. not sure but it seems good. also I've been working on the Quickie Shower-Stand idea and I want to actually do it right, so I decided to quit smoking weed. today at the soup kitchen there was definite effort to get me to smoke weed but I resisted. however, I noticed that the food was a bit different -- so I'm wondering if the food manifestations happen while I'm stoned, but maybe not when I'm sober -- not sure. either way, I'll ask cause if my smoking makes their food burden lighter and easier, then I'm down to smoke -- but I gotta say, even though I'm less than 24h into it, I'm already really enjoying the sobriety. I just really like how much easier it is to process everything.
    the other thing I picked up on was that perhaps I'm so close to getting super-consciousness, that if I just go sober for a little bit then I'll have it -- just a matter of time, really. *however*, if that's the case, then I'm actually thinking of going opposite of that and starting up the vraylar stuff again (for reasons too long to explain typing on the phone) and keep myself away from getting super-consciousness for essentially as long as possible. the vraylar makes it so that I don't get any of those dopamine hits -- "aha!" or "O" moments -- so it feels like I don't have any inspiring thoughts, even if they are inspiring -- but most of all the way that I saw dopamine working (before I took the vraylar cause now it doesn't work the same) is that those molecules emit when they get triggered, which is the "aha" part of it (and for me it also produces an image) but I think that emission is what they're trying to reduce because that's what affects others. so, if I reduce my emission by taking vraylar then that's better right? either way I wanna delay the super-consciousness thing for as long as possible. I have eternity to be like that and only a limited time as a mortal so I wanna enjoy that. it does seem like perhaps if someone wanted to team up with me and use my capacities on drugs, I could go higher and higher and get as much information out of the cloud that they'd want -- and also delay super-consciousness a bit more too.
anyway so going back to the Quickie Shower-Stand idea, I've got to talk to a bunch of saturnian guys to get the thing going -- and "nothing good comes from Saturn" right? -- but I don't feel bad about the idea while sober, and I think it'll still feel good to me on Monday too -- so it feels like a green light to me. maybe my job is only to get the ball rolling and then they can take it from there... not sure. one day at a time

### 2024-08-30 19:47 - what a crazy day

so many things happened today, it's impossible to say them all especially since I'm on the phone again (I actually kinda like it cause I can write anywhere), so to sum it up I guess the thing I learned is 1. don't write about what I'm doing (the previous entry seems to have caused problems) and 2. stay single: just walking around with kristy today made me realize that I just blindly become a reflection of whatever person I'm around. then, with being sober it was way worse -- but it seems that nobody can talk to me about what affects I have on others so that I can adjust or anything -- so I just keep making all the wrong actions. I think I'm gonna stay sober on weed because I think it could be fun to do the shower thing, but at this rate, it feels that even that project has fallen through. it's ok though because I can shower at mom's house twice a week -- so not much of a problem for me. at any rate, as I get more and more sober, it feels like things are going to start to get really crazy; lots of people in a city centre like that and they're going to have to find a way to like sober-kenny; there's no other way.
so, I don't really know what to do. I'm gonna try the shower thing, but if I hit a brick wall on it, I think I'm just gonna be sober in pueblo for a while where people don't like me to be sober. oh well, I guess.

### 2024-09-12 13:06 - stuck in pueblo

so here's the thing: now that Utah is my supposed destination, I went to have a look at it -- so I looked up the homeless shelter in cedar city to see what it's like and stuff. it's got a few losers that feel entitled and stuff giving bad reviews (to which they responded "our mistake we want to correct it"), but generally all super positive reviews. it's like the complete opposite of here -- like *too nice* -- like all the difficulty of homelessness is gone easy feeling. I don't really like that. one of the things that I really like about being here is how physical I'm required to be. I touch dirt. I have to walk everywhere. I have to focus on my physical needs, schedule bathroom trips, etc. it's really good for me. I like having to do that, and if I go to Utah, I'm gonna be back to my old way of living in my mind again, sitting around thinking and stuff (cause I'll have a computer and a house again, so everything will be done on a digital device again). that's one of the reasons why I like drugs, pulling weeds, and being homeless so much -- is cause I'm actually doing stuff with my body and hands. I don't really want to go back to living in my head again. I'm poor at predicting stuff it seems, and I like the real-time decision making. even having to go to Mom's house was starting to get too much. I want to do that less. I want to float around more than I want to be stuck, and I kinda like the difficulty too. so, even if I were to be homeless in cedar city, I still don't feel like I'll be happy cause it's so easy.
yesterday, I had the idea to just go to Utah. I could just fly a sign until I have the $120 needed for the greyhound to get there -- and just go (don't wait for dad or nothin) -- then just live there homelessly instead of here. from there I'm sure I'll be charismatic enough to find the right people to start working on my genetics project. it seems like a good idea and stuff but I keep getting this feeling like I'm trying to escape from my cage/home, which isn't what I want to do. if I go out of here, I have to present myself to the world -- and they'll probably like me (which means I go too fast). here everyone hates me, so it's good, and life speed feels very manageable. I just don't know what to do, but sitting in a house staring at a computer screen doesn't feel good to me. I don't know what to do. developing.
