### 2024-09-15 15:19 - first thoughts

yesterday I went to friendly harbor by accident, and talked with jennifer and dominique. I didn't really put the puzzle pieces together until after I'd left and was thinking about the conversation last night (to the dismay of those at the shelter, cause I think they hear my thoughts). this is also an extension to a conversation that I had with susan as well, where I provide a bit of a more broad overview of patterns that I noticed. my poor sisters; they always wanted me to be a really good figure in their lives, but I simply couldn't ever be what they wanted because (I know now) of their attraction. I consider melissa to be the standard earth girl reflector (-7) and jessica to be a female vulcan (-5+) -- which roughly correspond to jennifer's daughter abby (like jessica) and dominique's daughter clara (like melissa). so, having paid attention to my sisters' relationships over the years, I noticed a common thread between the three of us. mom (who is somewhere between -5+ and -3) always had difficulties with my father, because he was often times emotionally quite absent (he doesn't talk about his emotions) and also physically often quite absent as well (he spent most of his time working or playing strategy computer games). as a result, melissa (-7) did the common thing that most girls of her type do -- which is to look for and be attracted to guys that will physically be there for her -- and to a large extent, she accomplished her goal with jeff and patrick -- who seemingly were around her physically quite a lot (jeff literally sat around at home not doing a whole lot). jessica and andrew however don't seem to have much of a physical relatioship though (ansdrew's always gone), and he's about as emotionally responcive as a brick wall. however, what jessica did accomplish though was to produce andrew a male heir, much like what was required of mom to produce me (fail), greg (partial success), and jaron (partial success) for dad.
now, my experience growing up is that no matter how hard I tried, it always worked out that I couldn't be there for my sisters just like dad wasn't able to be there for them either. they wanted me to, but I felt strong resistance to trying to engage myself into their boyfriend issues and other nonsense, because I thought it was a waste of time. I had a goal that I felt very strongly that I wanted to use technology and computers to "take over the world" and to produce tech that I thought was cool and others would enjoy -- and having to deal with girl problems seemed like the quickest way to throw that dream/goal into the toilet -- ao I juat ignored them and let them go their own way, because even if I did help them, the skills I would learn (how to have relationships with girls) didn't interest me to further my goal -- and the only possible reward I could get out of it would be to gain friendships with some of their girlfriends -- which again, is counter-productive to what I wanted to do. so I saw my sisters and my involvement in their lives to be a complete waste of time -- which I think dad also found them to be a waste of time, as well. I don't think that now because my goals have shifted, but I still feel like they're a waste of time though. I've come to realize that actually the way that I feel about them *must have something to do with thier attraction* -- and consequently I've given a lot of thought to the subject.
they way I've come to work it out, is that melissa must expect all guys to be just as physically unavailable as dad is/was, and so she's attracted to the opposite of that -- and jessica must be out there to prove mom's concepts of what men are like as true. I think this pattern can be generalised as well, as I've noticed the same with other female vulcans as well, like for example raquel constantly had to prove that I am the way that her mom thinks that guys are -- and no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't ever escape it; I was always machista and stuff.
at any rate, there's simply nothing that I can do about thier attraction -- and I can try to learn not to prove them right about stuff, but I'll always do the thing that they expect "all guys" to do. as an example, I often times hang out with susan, and it happens nearly every time that I do just the thing to piss her off (ask her for her vape or be entitled to her stuff), and it's not even something I'm trying to do, but it's her attraction. I know she's not going to change her attraction anytime soon, so around her, I have all kinds of extra behavioural logic associated with doing the "right thing" so she doesn't get upset -- cause if I just be myself, I perform all of her (unwanted and wanted) expectations for her. I cant do anything other than to constantly remind them (susan is just the example here) that instead of "being right" about their expectations/fears of us (being clingy/entitled/etc), to instead figure it out *what it is they want*, and allow that to happen. I often times find myself doing wierd/stranger things for girls because they expect it of me.
figure out what it is that you want to attract, and find a way to make that happen, and don't *need* the unwanted stuff to happen so that you're right -- is my advice [to be continued. I want to talk more about jennifer/abby, and not susan]
