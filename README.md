# plastic-kenny

*plastic: flexible or pliable -- mouldable to a desired shape.*

I've lost my sense of self, which means that I will become the thing that my environment shapes me to be. inotherwords, I'm beginning to become something, and it's largely dictated by my surroundings.

- [blahblog](/bladblog.md) - where I talk things out on subjects that are of importance to me.
- [explanations](/explanations.md) - random topics I feel like explaining.
- [drug-talk](/drug-talk.md) - a place for me to talk about drugs.
    - [drug-theory](/drug-theory.md) - sometimes I come up with theories about drugs (or while on drugs), and I'm not ashamed to be wrong.
- [girl-talk](/girl-talk.md) - a place for me to talk about girls.
- [the-plan](/the-plan.md) - my (perceived) current course of action.

### back-story

so, mom decided it was time for me to move out. the computer I was using to write on [heavyk](https://github.com/heavyk) is still at her house, and until I have a place to set it up, I don't have access to the [heavyk](https://github.com/heavyk) account. I don't really mind that I have to start over -- and in fact, I think it's a good idea even. so, I'm *starting over* with everything.
