this repository is an extension to all of the writing I did on [heavyk](https://github.com/heavyk).

- [blahblog](/bladblog.md) - where I talk things out on subjects that are of importance to me
- [the-plan](/the-plan.md) - my (perceived) current course of action

### background

mom decided it was time for me to move out. the computer I was using to write on [heavyk](https://github.com/heavyk) is still at her house, and until I have a place to set it up, I don't have access to the [heavyk](https://github.com/heavyk) account. I don't really mind that I have to start over -- and in fact, I think it's a good idea even. so, I'm *starting over* with everything.
